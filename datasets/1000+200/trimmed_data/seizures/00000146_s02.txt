MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ASA, Norvase 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient has a craniotomy 
defect. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a pattern with 
marked background disorganization. There are intermittent sharp and slow wave. 
complexes seen independently from the right or left temporal region. Disorganized 
background, both arrhythmic delta activity and FURTA are identified. Stimulation of the 
patient produces an alerting response. At the close of the record, a train of right 
temporal spike and slow wave complexes are observed. These resolve before the close 
of the record. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Right temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes, some of 
which are more prominent than they were previously. 
3. Occasional left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is nonspecific but raises 
concerns about worsening underlying encephalopathy, or subtle undetected seizures. 
Additional evaluation may be appropriate.
