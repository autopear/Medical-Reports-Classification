MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Zonisamide, Dilantin, and Phenobarbital since yesterday.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient reported no clinical events, and none were identified by the room nurses. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency pattern with a right frontotemporal breach rhythm and sharply contoured delta.  There are occasional spikes identified at F4 and at times T6.  During sleep, the amplitude on the right is less prominent and generally the EEG shows significant variability.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves with spindle activity. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved in this record.   
Numerous spike detections were recorded during this 24-hour period, and five to six brief focal motor episodes of seizure activity were noted, which were correlated with rhythmic spike discharges with phase reversal over C3, lasting no more than 20 seconds.  The first episode occurred at 7:54 AM and the last one occurred at 8:11 AM.  No generalized seizure activity was seen during this recording.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Brief episodes of focal motor seizure activity with a focus over C3 occurring five to six times in the morning. 
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with sharply contoured delta and occasional spike discharges, maximum over F4 and a breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This long-term tracing is supportive of a partial mechanism for epilepsy, as well as a structural abnormality in the right frontotemporal area and in the left central area.  There was no generalized seizure activity found in this tracing.
