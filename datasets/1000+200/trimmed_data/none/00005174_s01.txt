MEDICATIONS:  Dexamethasone, Pantoprazole, Dilantin, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake and restless.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a disorganized pattern with marked irregular delta in the frontal regions shifting from right to light.  In addition to the arrhythmic delta activity, there are sharp waves, most of which are in the right frontal region or right frontal temporal.  Of note, the arrhythmic delta activity is a bit more prominent in the left
and there are some sharp waves which will phase reverse at T1.  The patient drifts off into sleep
with some vertex waves.   Stimulation  of the patient  just prior to the stimulation of the patient there is a bit of beta activity in the right frontal central region.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity and may also accentuate sharp waves at F4.
	HR: 	120 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Disorganized background.
	2. 	Arrhythmic frontal delta.
	3. 	Sharp waves in the frontal and frontal temporal regions, most prominent in the right frontal temporal regions, but present bilaterally.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are congruent with this patient's imaging.  No seizures were recorded.
