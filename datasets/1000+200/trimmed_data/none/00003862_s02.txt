MEDICATIONS: Haldol, Zyprexa, Dilantin, and antihypertensives. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as lethargic.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The primary frequency in the background is beta.  There are intermittent, sharp waves or sharply contoured periodic complexes identified from the right hemisphere, including the centrotemporal regions and occasionally the mid-to-posterior temporal regions.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in background theta.  There is an asymmetry with greater faster frequency activity on the right. 
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent sharp waves from the right hemisphere.
Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The amplitude asymmetry with a beta accentuation may be due to a breach rhythm following a craniotomy.  The frequent sharp waves suggest an ongoing, cortical irritability.  No seizures were recorded.  If subclinical seizures are an important consideration, a 24-hour EEG could be useful.  In comparison to a previous study, the background activity from the right is less attenuated.  Although there is frequent epileptiform activity seen in this record, this activity may in fact be less than that seen in a previous study.
