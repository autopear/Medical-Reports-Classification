MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Codeine, Zofran, Labetalol, Hydralazine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is on a face mask in 
a hard collar and is relatively somnolent. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and demonstrates an 
intrahemispheric asymmetry. The activity on the right is lower voltage, more 
featureless. On the left includes theta activity, some arrhythmic delta activity, and a 
breech rhythm, particularly left frontal region. Out of the context of a breech, there was 
an underlying left frontal sharp wave. This can be associated with after going slow 
waves and occurs in brief trains. Left focal slowing in a patient with left frontal sharp 
waves sometimes in trains. 
HR: 126 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Left sided focal slowing in breech rhythm. 
2. Left frontal sharp waves. 
3. Overall very low voltage, low pattern, including on the right. 
CLINICAL No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a 
relatively irritative process.
