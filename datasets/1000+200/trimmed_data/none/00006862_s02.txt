INTRODUCTION: A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode and anterior temporal electrodes. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was performed. The patient was obtunded during the recording. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: None. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to diffusely slow delta background EEG with no normal posterior dominant rhythm. No normal sleep architecture was seen and during photic stimulation no abnormal discharges were seen. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
1. Focal sharp waves or spikes were seen: T4/C4 periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) with a frequency of 0.5 Hz and an amplitude of 60 to 150 microvolts were seen. 
2. Focal slow waves at C4/T4 at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts seen continuously with intermixed increased faster frequencies and an associated breach. 
3. Generalized slow waves. 
SEIZURES: None. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to left centro-temporal PLEDs and slowing in addition to generalized slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with acute focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the left centro-temporal region, which is consistent with the known tumor. In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect. No seizures were seen.
