MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine, aspirin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is lethargic throughout the record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow.  The overall pattern is a mixed frequency of 4 to 7 Hz theta with rhythmic delta.  There are some shifting asymmetries.  At times, there is a bit more arrhythmic delta on the left compared to the right.  There are rare, well-defined, high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes in this record.  At times, there is a bit more rhythmic theta identified from the right hemisphere. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Left temporal sharp waves.
Subtle asymmetries with a bit more faster frequency activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Compared to a previous study, there is less epileptiform activity seen in this study.  The overall background remains slow.  No seizures were recorded.
