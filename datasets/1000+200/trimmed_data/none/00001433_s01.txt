INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is quite somnolent during the EEG. Testing is performed during the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are sections of the record when the patient is awake with a 6-8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. She drifts into stage 1 and stage 2 sleep. When she falls asleep, with vertex waves, spindles, K-complexes, it is difficult to arouse the patient. The technologist works to keep the patient awake throughout much of the EEG. There are occasional bursts of sharply contoured slowing seen at T3 as the patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep. 
HR: 60bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing and disorganization. 
2. Background shifting slowing. 
3. Occasional bursts of sharply contoured slowing, particularly from the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. The patient's clinical events appear to be more of a disorder of hypersomnolence.
