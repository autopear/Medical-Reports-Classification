MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital and fentanyl.
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed in the neonatal ICU using the neonatal montage. This is a 90-minute EEG. The child was in a closed infant Isolette, on a warmer with an oscillator. There is a great deal of artifact noted in the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: By the extraordinary amount of background artifacts, the overall EEG is relatively low voltage for an infant of this age. There are many artifacts, including an electrical artifact given a long cord length in between the infant and the EEG machine due to the equipment. Movements in the background by others create artifact in the EEG and the oscillator frequently creates artifact that even obscures the EKG. The infant moves occasionally, but no myoclonic movements are noted, and when he does so, there is some muscle artifact. Although this is a relatively low-voltage and suppressed record, there are sections of the record with the next frequency pattern underneath the other artifacts.
Heart rate was 150 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Technically extremely challenging EEG, but remarkable for somewhat lower voltage pattern than anticipated.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This infant remains at extreme prematurity in terms of EEG. Morphology such as delta brushes were not identified in this EEG; however, there was so many technical limitations that few conclusions can be drawn. In any case, no seizures were recorded.
