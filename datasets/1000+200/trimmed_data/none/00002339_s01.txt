MEDICATIONS: Keppra. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated. She is relatively awake. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a quite prominent 
intrahemispheric asymmetry. There is a 9Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified from the left hempisphere. The left hemisphere is relatively unremarkable, but the right hemisphere demonstrates continuous frontally predominant delta. Some of this does spread to the left frontal region, but the majority of it is on the right. There is also disruption of faster frequency activity, although on occasion the alpha rhythm is identified on the right. The patient is reactive throughout the study. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due: 
1. Continuous right frontal delta. 
2. Sharply contoured activity in the same region. 
3. Disruption of faster frequency in the right hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with a right frontal mass. No seizures were recorded.
