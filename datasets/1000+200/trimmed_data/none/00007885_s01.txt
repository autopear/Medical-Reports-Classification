MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Coumadin, and many others. (CHECK MEDS)
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is initially unresponsive and then later demonstrates responsiveness.     
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, in the ICU, the background is diffusely slow with primarily a delta and theta frequency pattern with a significant amount of artifact.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting with eye opening, eye closure, and a significant increase in background muscle.  There is shifting, arrhythmic delta activity.  As the recording continues, the background is richer in alpha frequency activity.  
HR:  136 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Initially, generalized background slowing.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter. No epileptiform activity was seen.  No seizures were recorded.   The improving mental status, as the recording continues with evidence of responsiveness, supports a dynamic or improving process.
