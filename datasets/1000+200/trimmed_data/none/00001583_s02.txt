INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 1 0ï¿½20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and asleep study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the start of this record, entrance C-are asymmetry is seen with some slow rhythms on the left hemisphere.  Shifting arrhythmic delta activity ADA is seen on the left hemisphere.  However, this turn of a posterior dominate alpha rhythm is seen, at times, reaching 10 Hz specifically on the right hemisphere,  but it  is seen bilaterally. The patient begins to fall asleep and stage 2 sleep is seen with K-complex and some vertex waves are seen.  Few bilateral sharp waves are seen.  Spindles with the K-complexes as well. The few bilateral sharp waves are seen anterior temporal regions.
HR:   84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Left focal slowing, shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
	2.	Bilateral sharp waves most anterior mid temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The interhemispheric asymmetry is consistent with the patient's history of the left gunshot wound and previous craniectomy with decompression and the epileptiform discharges are consistent with foci for epilepsy, but no seizures are recorded. Comparative to previous study done on 5/8/2009, there is improvement in the overall background.
