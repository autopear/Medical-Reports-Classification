INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was performed. The patient is somnolent. The right craniotomy was observed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates  an interhemispheric asymmetry. The activity from the right is relatively suppressed with low voltage, featureless delta and smaller amounts of theta. The left hemisphere demonstrates a more variable pattern, at times with rhythmic theta, at times with arrhythmic delta. Spontaneous eye opening is observed. Features of apparent change
in state include a decrease in rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits an arousable response but no driving response.
HR:  78 bpm, irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
	1. 	Markedly slow background, suppressed on the right.
	2. 	Slow background from the left with a mixture of theta and some delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports his severe, underlying encephalopathy involving gray and white matter. No seizures were recorded.
