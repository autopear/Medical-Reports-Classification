Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record begins, a slow background is seen 
extensively with theta activity at 6 hertz. During the record, sharply contoured waves are 
seen in the right and left hemispheres in the anterior temporal regions. 
HR: 66 bpm and very irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Moderately slow background. 
2. Frontal and anterior temporal sharp waves seen in the right and left hemispheres. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded on this record, but epileptiform 
discharges were seen in both hemispheres. The slowing of the background is 
nonspecific and could be seen in a toxic metabolic encephalopathy; bi-hemispheric 
pathology or postictal state.
