MEDICATIONS:  Lantus, Lovenox, Insulin, Plavix, Hydralazine, Pantoprazole.  No antiepileptic medicines.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG iwas performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The recording is continuous.  The background consists of polymorphic, low-to-moderate amplitude mixture of theta and delta with occasional under riding faster frequencies.  Additional polymorphic delta and slightly lower amplitude are observed over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular rate with frequent PVCs.
FINDINGS:  
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal slowing over the left hemisphere.
No normal sleep architecture.
No seizures.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left hemisphere.  These findings indicate diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology.  Focal slowing over the left hemisphere is suggestive of underlying focal cerebral pathology. No seizures are captured.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.
