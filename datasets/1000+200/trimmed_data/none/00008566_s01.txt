MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation performed.  Awake and asleep study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During wakefulness, the record is a little disorganized with a posterior dominant alpha rhythm at 8.5 - 9 hertz.  During wakefulness, sharp waves are seen in the T1-T3 region.  This asymmetry of the sharp waves continues as the record continues.  At times, these sharp waves are followed by FIRDA activity in bursts in the left frontal regions. As the patient becomes sleepy and enters stage II sleep seen with K-complexes and spindles and vertex waves, a new sharp wave is seen predominantly in the bifrontal regions, again seen more on the left hemisphere.  During hyperventilation there is some decreasing of the amplitude.  During photic stimulation the patient is seen drowsy, but without driving. There is some increase in the sharp wave activity in the bifrontal regions.
	HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mid temporal sharp wave seen in the left.
	2.	Bifrontal, but mostly left frontal, sharp waves seen, especially during sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There are 2 foci for seizure activity seen in this patient, both in the left hemisphere,  originally in the mid temporal region and then later in the left frontal region.
There are no seizures recorded in this record.
