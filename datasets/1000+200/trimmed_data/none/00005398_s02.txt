LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  25 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Current seizure medication:  Dilantin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  During maximal wakefulness, there is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude mixture of theta and delta and occasional alpha.  During sleep, brief periods of discontinuity and rare vertex-like wave forms are observed.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  Occasional predominantly left frontal sharp waves are captured.  On several occasions, these sharp waves appear to be generalized.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate up to 120 beats a minute.
		
FINDINGS:  
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal moderate slowing over the right hemisphere.
Occasional left frontal sharp waves with after-going slow waves, that on rare occasions appear to be generalized.
No seizures observed.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal right hemispheric slowing, and occasional left frontal epileptiform discharges that rarely appear to be more broadly based.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiology nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  There is a potential epileptogenic focus over the left frontal region.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
