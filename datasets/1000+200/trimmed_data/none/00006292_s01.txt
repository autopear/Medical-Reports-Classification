MEDICATIONS:  Unknown    
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded only in wakefulness. Activating procedures with hyperventilation and photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:    None.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. 
Note:  This EEG was only performed in wakefulness.  If clinical suspicion of seizures is still a concern, repeat EEG with deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.
