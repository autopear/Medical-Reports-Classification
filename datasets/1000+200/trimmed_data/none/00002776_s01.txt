INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record opens,  a very slow disorganized background is seen,  mostly with theta pattern at 6-7 hertz.  Overall, it is sharply contoured and there are multifocal sharp waves seen independently in the left and right frontal regions occipitally in 01 greater than 02 and in the C4 region.  Frontally, bilateral triphasic waves are also seen.   Also, in the occipital regions, arrhythmic delta activity is seen as well. Not much change occurs during stimulation.
	HR:	96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized sharply contoured disorganized background.
	2.	Multifocal sharp waves seen in the frontal regions right more than left, in the occipital regions left more than right, and in the right central region.
	3.	Bilateral triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is consistent epileptiform activity throughout this record that could be foci for a diagnosis of epilepsy.  No seizures, however, were seen on this recording as this ends.  The slowing of the background and triphasic waves
are nonspecific, but could be seen in a diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
