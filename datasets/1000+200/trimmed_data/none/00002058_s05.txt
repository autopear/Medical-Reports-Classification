MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone, Valproic Acid. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG pattern today is burst suppression with periods of activity of up to 3 seconds, with periods of suppression as long as 11 seconds. The cerebral activity includes rhythmic theta and alpha. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Burst suppression pattern. 
2. Absence of reactivity or variability.
 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are poor prognostic features. No seizures were recorded.
