MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. TI1e patient is intubated and poorly arousable.
DESCR  IPTION  OF THE  RECORD: As  the tracing opens, the background  EEG is diffusely slow and the patient is lethargic.  The overall pattern is one of lower voltage  theta from  the left hemisphere.   From the right hemisphere,  there is an un usual pattern.   There is low voltage theta with fast activity identified in the ri ght occipitotemporal region as well as underlying delta in that region.    In addition,  there  are  sharp  waves  identified  from  the  right  centrotemporal    region. Stimulation of the patient produces a clear alerting response with an increase in alpha frequency activity,  which  is  much  more prominent  from  the left than  the right,  but  which  can  be seen bilaterally.  With stimulation, although there is movement and motion artifact, the focal slowing and fast activity persists  through the awake record.  TI1e combination  of focal mixed theta-delta and fast activity can occur as brief discharges or as bursts lasting up to 3 seconds.
IIR:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Prominent focal  slowing and fast activity from the right occipitotemporal  region.
2.   Right centrotemporal sharp waves.
3.   Asymmetry with more disruption of faster frequency activity from the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the prominent epileptiform  activity, stimulation  of the patient produces a clear alerting response.  This suggests an irritative process but no seizures were recorded  an d  stimulation   of  the  patient  clearly  produces  an  alerting  response  despite   the prominent epileptifom1 activity.
