MEDICATIONS: Neurontin, Plavix, Klonopin, Coozar, ASA 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is somewhat 
slow with rhythmic 7-8 hertz frequency. In addition, his temporal wicked activity and a 
sharply contoured background. There are also sharp waves identified which standout 
for the wicked seen independently in the right and left temporal region. Some from the 
left have an F7 maximum and others are more mid temporal T3. Those from the right 
also demonstrate some variability in terms of T4 of C4. Features of drowsiness include 
an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the 
record. 
HR: 70 bpm frequent PVCs and irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Independent temporal sharp waves of the maximum including anterior 
temporal, mid temporal or central temporal depending on whether they area 
present on the right or the left. 
2. Background slowing. 
3. Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm for a subject of this age. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded today. Localization 
mechanism for epilepsy.
