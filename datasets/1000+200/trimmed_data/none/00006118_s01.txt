		MEDICATIONS: 	Ciprofloxacin, multiple antibiotics and Ativan. INTRODUCTION: 		Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using
standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
The patient is somnolent but arousable.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:	Much of the EEG demonstrates a slow or sleep pattern. The morphology is compatible with sleep including
vertex waves. Brief arousals are associated with a lower voltage mixed
frequency pattern with theta and delta. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity. When left unstimulated, occasional, very slow generalized arrhythmic delta activity is identified.
HR: 120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mixed frequency slow background.
	2. 	Occasional prominent, very slow arrhythmic delta.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	These features are nonspecific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. The presence of reactivity, as well as some normal sleep waveforms are positive prognostic features. No seizures nor epileptiform features were identified.
