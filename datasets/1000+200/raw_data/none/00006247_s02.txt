CLINICAL HISTORY: 77 year old male with profound hyponatremia, hypotension, unresponsiveness with asterixis. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Triamterene, Glipizide, Lisinopril, Atenolol, Lipitor, Avelox 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has eye-opening and is described as responsive. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a mixed frequency pattern with rhythmic delta. Eye movement Is noted. There are occasional triphasic waves. The EEG demonstrates a somewhat variable pattern. At times there is a bit more rhythmic theta in comparison to other sections. There is also a little bit of asymmetry with a little more prominent triphasic wave forms in the left frontal region as compared to the right. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Moderate background slowing. 
2. Occasional triphasic waves. 
3. Occasional shifting slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The pattern does show a reactive background with variability. No seizures were recorded. This is most compatible with a metabolic pattern.
