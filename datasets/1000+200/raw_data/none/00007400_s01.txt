CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 56-year-old woman with left skull defect.  Patient had a craniotomy in 1979 for an AVM with chronic epidural hematoma and uncontrolled epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Keppra. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  This EEG is an interesting pattern.  The appearance is one that would suggest a breach rhythm on the right rather than the left with higher amplitude activity on that side and some head rocking artifact, particularly at C4.  The activity from the left hemisphere is lower voltage and a bit more attenuated, although there is a suggestion of a left temporal sharp wave on one occasion.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background slowing.  The patient is confused throughout much of the EEG.  As she becomes drowsy, there is an increase in arrhythmic delta from the right posterior quadrant. 
Photic stimulation may accentuate epileptiform activity from the occipital region, although there was some similar activity seen in this record at baseline. 
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Challenging but abnormal EEG due to:
	Background disorganization.
	Arrhythmic delta from the right.
	Amplitude asymmetry with a lower amplitude record on the left compared to the right.
	Sharp waves from the occipital regions bilaterally in the left temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  Correlation with imaging is appropriate given the confusing findings described above.
