INTRODUCTION: 
Routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 standard electrode placement system with EKG anterior temporal electrodes. Stage I and photic stimulation was performed with no hyper-ventilation. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Include Keppra, metoprolol, amlodipine, aspirin, Lovenox, and benztropine. 
MEDICAL PROBLEMS: 
Increased muscle artifact specifically over the temporal lobes, but more on the right than the left with the majority of the recording. 
HISTORY: 
A 60-year-old female with history of hypertension, diabetes, previous stroke with right hemiparesis, admitted with episodes of eye rolling back with no memory of the event and also episodes of incontinence. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to posterior dominant rhythm that at best is 7 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening and eye closing, and mild frontocentral beta. Stage I steep is recorded. Photic stimulation does not produce any abnormal discharges and no hyperventilation was performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
1. Continuous focal slow waves are seen at F7-T3 and a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 80 microvolts. 
2. Generalized slow waves in the theta frequency of 5 Hz to 7 Hz and 20 to 50 microvolts amplitude. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to continuous left anterior temporal slowing as well as mild generalized slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with an old stroke. There is also evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
