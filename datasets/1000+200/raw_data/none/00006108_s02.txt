CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 15-year-old female born at eight months gestation.  History of mental retardation and cerebral palsy with seizures since childhood; last seizure was 10/16/04 with generalized tonic-clonic activity followed by loss of consciousness as well as subsequent postictal confusion and sleep.  She has about one to three episodes per week.  
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the Pediatric Outpatient Unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal with delta and beta frequency, as well as small theta frequency activity. There are several sharp and slow waves identified at C4/CZ, C3/P3, and O2.  There is also some intermittent occipital delta.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Multifocal spike and slow wave activity.
Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a localization-related mechanism for this patientâ€™s epilepsy.  No seizures were recorded.
