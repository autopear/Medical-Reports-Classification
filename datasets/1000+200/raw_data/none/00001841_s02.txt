CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old woman status post PEA code 6/20/09 for 25 minutes, now needing neurologic evaluation. 
MEDICATIONS: Zocor, Insulin, Depakote, Clindamycin, Protonix, lsordil, Nystatin, Valproic, ASA, Metoprolol, Heparin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient has a tracheostomy and is poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is subtly discontinuous. 
There is slow, frontally predominant APE OS and occasional triphasic waves. There are also some sharp waves which appear in the posterior quadrant more so on the right. There seems to be an unusual field of spread for a sharp wave in this record with positivity at T4. Stimulation of the patient produces a small amount of background slowing. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly slow and abnormal background. 
2. Triphasic waves. 
3. A handful of sharp waves or potentially epileptiform discharges including some periodic sharp waves and focal sharp waves as well as positive sharps. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEGs supports an epileptiform potential. No seizures were recorded. This background supports a poor prognosis following cardiac arrest. This is similar to prior EEGs.
