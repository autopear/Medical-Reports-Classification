CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old with refractory epilepsy currently seizure free. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Klonopin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in the prominent beta. There are brief portions of the record with a periodic complex in the right mid to anterior temporal region. In addition, there is a single right frontotemporal sharp wave. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation is performed at the close of the record when the patient is somewhat drowsy. There is a driving response identifiable despite the beta activity. In addition, during photic stimulation, the high amplitude right anterior temporal sharp waves are observed with significant field of spread at right frontotemporal and frontocentral. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Intermittent focal slowing observed in drowsiness through stage II sleep. 
3. Right anterior temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a location related mechanism for epilepsy. Of note, the patient is in stage II sleep during photic stimulation which may be related to an underlying sleep deficit or another disturbance of excessive sleepiness. His medications may contributory to the sleepiness observed.
