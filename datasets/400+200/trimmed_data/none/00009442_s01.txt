MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ibuprofen, Fosphenytoin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is asleep, rocking in its mother’s arms. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the record includes stage II sleep.  There are vertex waves identified but using some montages the vertex waves appear to be somewhat asymmetric, higher amplitude from the left central region.  In addition, there is asymmetric spindle activity with the majority of the spindles identified on the right although some were seen bilaterally.  As the child reaches stage III sleep, appropriate quantities of 2 Hz delta activity are seen.  The delta is posterior.  It appears that there is some artifact in the right posterior quadrant when the child’s head rests on the mother’s arm, but no definitive focality.  
HR:  145 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Asymmetries identified in sleep with a bit more spindle activity from the right and an unusual field of the vertex activity with higher amplitude vertex on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  Correlation with imaging may be useful to assure that there is no structural or functional abnormality.
