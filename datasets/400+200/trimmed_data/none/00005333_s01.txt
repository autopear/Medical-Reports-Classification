	MEDICATIONS: 	Ativan, metoprolol, aspirin.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
The patient is examined during the EEG.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	The patient is comatose and intubated. The background EEG with the patient resting quietly includes a low
voltage, relatively featureless pattern. Stimulation of the patient
does not clearly activate the record. There are a handful of bursts of shifting slowing including 1 or 2 bursts of sharply contoured spikes from the right or left hemisphere. Rare left temporal sharp waves are identified.
	HR: 	66-80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Moderately severe background slowing.
2. Absence of clear reactivity.
	3. 	Shifting slowing.
4. Rare left temporal sharp waves.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a hi-hemisphere process and a significant underlying encephalopathy. At the close of the record, tactile stimulation produced a somewhat attenuated pattern, but
further recording was not performed to determine the duration of this.
No seizures were recorded. This study performed 48 hours post-code carries concerns for a significant encephalopathy. Because of the changes seen at the very end of the record, a repeat study is recommended.
