MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system  of electrode  placement  with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation  was performed.   This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background EEG has an unusual pattern.   Although there  is  a  discernable  7  Hz  posterior  dominant  rhytlm1, there  are  bursts  of rhytlm1ic high amplitude  3 to 5 Hz activity  seen in the occipital  regions bilaterally  with a generous  field  of spread.  This may be seen unilaterally or bilaterally, and at times seems to have a spike and sloÂ·w wave discharge in it   There  are also bursts  of frontally predominant  high amplitude  rhythmic activity.  These bursts do not consistently  have an underlying spike  and slow complex, although there is occasiona lly a spike and slow complex  i dentified in these bursts,  maximum  i n the left frontocentral  region.   Photic stim ulation appears to accentuate the rhythmic  activity  as well as producing some rhythmic theta frequency activity from the left hemisphere.
HR:  90BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1 .  Unusual, occipitally predominant paroxysmal activity with underlying spike and slow wave activi ty.
2.   Occasional focal spikes or some that are apparent in the frontal reg ions.
3.   Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures  were recorded. This paroxysmal activi ty supports perhaps   a  secondary   generalized  mechanism   for  epilepsy,   as   well   as  localization-related mech anisms.       Comparison  wi th  previous  outpatient EEGs  may  be  val uable.   In  that  this individual  is  reported  to be declining,  one might an ticipate a progression  of EEG changes.  A previous EEG done on 4/6/05 was not available for comparison.
