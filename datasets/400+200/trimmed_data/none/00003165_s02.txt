MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Valproate, Midazolam, Morphine.

Continuous digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the burn 
unit using standard10-20 sy stem of electrode placementwith1 channel of EKG. The 
patient is intubated and sedated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to demonstrate a 
markedly abnormal pattern. Ongoing, left posterior temporal spike and slow wave 
complexes are observed. The overall background is improved in that there is some low 
voltage theta and smaller amounts of delta activity seen from the right. The epileptiform 
activity from the left posterior temporal region is remarkable for some associated fast 
activity and there is a bit more fast activity in the left hemisphere. The sharp waves from 
the left reach a maximum of 75 microvolts. Using an average reference, 
they are 
maximum at O1 the left occipital region greater than T5 . Over the course of the record, 
there is waxing and waning of the epileptiform activity . Stimulation of the patient does 
not significantly activate the record. There are intermittent, subtle discontinuies in the background. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. 
Left temporal occipital spike and slow wave and associated fast activity. 
2. 
Markedly abnormal background. 
3. 
Interhemispheric asymmetry with more theta from the right and a mixture of the 
sharp waves and beta from the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. 
The overall background is 
improved,
but there is a prominent area of epileptogenicity on the occipital temporal 
region. Correlation with imaging and history is advised. 
In this critically ill patient, ongoing observation to prevent additional seizures is recommended.
