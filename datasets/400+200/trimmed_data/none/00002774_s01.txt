	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard10-20 system of electrode placement with1 channel of EKG. The patient is on a ventilator.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:	Background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal and relatively suppressed pattern. The activity from the right is low voltage, slow, and very suppressed. There is cerebral activity identified from the left, but it is somewhat discontinuous. There is variability in the record. At times there is low voltage beta frequency bilaterally. Higher amplitude on the left   compared to the right. In addition on the left   is a scant amount of beta and alpha frequency activity. Although there is a notation by the technologist that barbiturate is planned, this EEG is slightly discontinuous.  Perhaps the Propofol anesthetic dose seemed to produce this pattern or the pentobarbital had started. Occasional left   anterior temporal sharp waves were observed.
Stimulation of the patient was performed while the individual is in a burst suppression pattern. Yields small increase in amplitude. An episode of arm tremor is associated with a decrease in the discontinuous pattern.
	HR:	70  bpm
	IMPRESSION:	Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Relatively suppressed pattern on the right.
	2.	Intermittent burst suppression pattern.
	3. 	Occasional sharp waves in the left   anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports a severe encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded.
