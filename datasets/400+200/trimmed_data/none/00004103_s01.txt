MEDICATIONS: Decadron, Zantac, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In drowsiness, there is an almost periodic sharp wave identified in the right frontal region.  This is associated with right frontal focal slowing.  With stimulation, the patient spontaneously awakens with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 9 Hz.  On rare occasions, in maximal wakefulness, a right frontal sharp wave can be identified. 
HR:  66 to 96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Periodic right frontal sharp and slow wave complexes, most prominent in light sleep but occasionally seen in wakefulness. 
Focal slowing in the right frontal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are in the region of this patientâ€™s stroke.  No seizures were recorded.  This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.
