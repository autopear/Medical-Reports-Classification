MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel 
EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somnolent throughout much of the record. In 
that state, the EEG is relatively low voltage and featureless with right occipital sharp waves with 
variable maximum and amplitude. Maximum increased 01/02, even T4A2. There is a generous 
field with the delta that follows the sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient initially produces a 
lower voltage alpha theta pattern followed by more of a medium to low amplitude theta pattern. 
The sharp waves are present throughout the EEG. There is a small degree of periodicity as 
seizures. Towards the close of the record when the patient is a bit more alert, the sharp waves 
are more prominent. At times the sharp wave have a polyphasic component and that is seen at 
the close of the record as the patient drifts into stage 2 sleep which obvious. Features of stage 2 
sleep include spindle activity. 
HR: 107 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Right occipital sharp waves and spikes with generous field of spread. 
2. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were observed. The prominent, periodic sharp waves 
may be followed clinically in this individual with altered mental status. The epileptiform activity 
and focal slowing is congruent with the CAT scan description.
