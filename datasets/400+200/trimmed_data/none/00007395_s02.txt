REASON FOR STUDY:  
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T4 electrode artifact occurring intermittently.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient had stage I sleep noted.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges. 
Heart rate 84. 
Abnormal discharges:  None. 
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
