MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Ativan, Fentanyl, Digoxin, aspirin, and Plavix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and includes a mixture of arrhythmic theta and delta.  Superimposed upon this are frontally predominant triphasic waves.  There are also occasional focal sharp waves identified in the record with variable maximum including left parietal and right mid-to-posterior temporal.  Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  There is no real attenuation of the triphasic waves or the periodic sharp waves.  There is no frequency evolution of the sharp waves and/or triphasic waves.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Marked background slowing. 
	Triphasic waves. 
	Intermittent periodic sharp waves identified from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports an irritative process, as well as an underlying toxic or metabolic process.  The renal failure can contribute to this patient as, of course, the anoxic injury.
