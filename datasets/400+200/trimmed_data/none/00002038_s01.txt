MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin, Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, comatose, with edematous fascies and eyes opened.    
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The initial pattern is relatively symmetric with bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude spike or sharp activity with bursts of fast activity followed by background suppression.  There are some portions of the record with bursts of activity lasting approximately 2 seconds followed by suppression of approximately 1.5 seconds.  Other sections of the record demonstrate more variability, as well as more fast activity or sharp activity from the right central region.  As the recording continues, the EEG undergoes a transition, although there is no notation that the patient received any additional medications.  In that transition, the background EEG becomes suppressed and there is a frontally predominant, relatively symmetric periodic complex, high amplitude, but superimposed upon a featureless background with background suppression ranging from 0.5 to 2 seconds.  Stimulation of the patient does not appear to produce a change in the background EEG, although the stimulation was performed as the EEG was making the transition to a more featureless, monomorphic pattern.   
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	PLEDS. 2. Absence of reactivity or variability.  3.  Deteriorating pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If this EEG was performed greater than 24 hours following cardiac arrest and, in the absence of sedative hypnotic medications, this EEG carries a poor prognosis.  No seizures were recorded, although this is an irritative pattern.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
