		MEDICATIONS: 	Isosorbide, Diltiazem, Chlorhexidine. INTRODUCTION: 		This is a digital video EEG performed in the
10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel lead of EKG.
This EEG is performed in the lab. Patient went from wakefulness to sleep. Photic stimulation was performed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm identified bilaterally. A prominent breech rhythm is identified from the left frontal temporal region. The background EEG demonstrates intermittent bursts of sharply contoured left anterior temporal and central temporal sharply contoured delta. Some of these bursts occur as the patient is drifting off to sleep. No clinical signs or symptoms are observed, although testing is not performed to be certain that there is really no impairment of awareness. In addition, even with the bursts of sharply contoured activity from the left, there is not significant disruption of the faster frequency activity in that area. Photic stimulation elicits small bilateral driving response.
HR: 96 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slow wave from the left anterior temporal region, at times sharply contoured with higher amplitude sharply contoured delta.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality, congruent with this patient's previous
neurosurgical  history. No seizures were recorded. Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
