MEDICATIONS: Nabumetone,  Neurontin,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy
record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized. There was also a great deal of muscle artifact. When the muscle artifact drops out there is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant with a pseudoperiodic complex in the right parietal/occipital region. Features of drowsiness included increase in background slowing and a prominence of the epileptiform activity described above.
	HR:	66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Background slowing.
	2.	Right posterior periodic delta.
	3.	Right occipital slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded. These findings may be correlated with imaging.
