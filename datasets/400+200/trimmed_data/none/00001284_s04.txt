REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of pressure and electric shocks in the head.
MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, metoprolol, aspirin, pravastatin, omeprazole, clonazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is excessive frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen almost continuously at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  In addition, there is an asymmetrical increased amplitude and faster frequencies in this region consistent with a breach rhythm.  Please note that at times, there are sharply contoured discharges, but not clearly epileptiform. 
Heart rate 78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left midtemporal focal slowing and breach.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is consistent with a known tumor resection surgery.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Please note that this is reported similar to the EEGs done in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
