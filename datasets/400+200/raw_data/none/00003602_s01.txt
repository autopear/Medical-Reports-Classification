uremia, dementia, stroke and HIV infection. Evaluate for renal failure. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Metoprolol, Aranesp, Pantoprazole Â· 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly 
responsive. He sits, tachypneic with his head turned to the le1. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low to 
medium amplitude, slow relatively featureless recording. Stimulation of the patient does . 
little to exacerbate the record. There is a small degree of variability in the amount of 
beta and the background . 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
2. Absence of definitive reactivity to tactile stimulation. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy. 
No seizures were recorded.
