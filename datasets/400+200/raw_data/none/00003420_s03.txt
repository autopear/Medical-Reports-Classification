CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old man with glioblastoma multiform, status post a craniotomy with resection x 2 and presents now with confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Decadron,  Metoprolol, Fluconazole
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Left skull defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins, very disorganized background  is seen.  In the left hemisphere a mixed pattern of the patient's left posterior breech rhythm, left arrhythmic delta activity with more theta than delta and at that same posterior region spike waves are seen in the T5 region. T5 spike waves are also seen in P3 and 01.  As the record continues head rocking artifact is seen.  The right
hemisphere also shows a slow background with sometimes a little bit more delta than theta activity.
	HR: 	90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized slowing of the background.
	2.	Increased left arrhythmic delta activity.
	3.	Left posterior temporal occipital spike waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The left posterior spike waves are consistent with localization for epilepsy.  Breech is also seen where the left posterior skull defect.  The generalized slowing of the background is consistent with a diffuse dysfunction of cerebral activity. No seizures were recorded.
