CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 39-year-old male with AIDS, hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse admitted due to abdominal pain.  Patientâ€™s hospital course was complicated by sepsis. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan and antibiotics. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, ventilator dependent, and unresponsive.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized and low voltage.  The normal posterior dominant rhythm is not seen.  After adjustment of the sensitivity, FIRDA activity as well as arrhythmic delta activity with a small amount of frontocentral beta is seen.  Some background activity can be seen with stimulation.  Transiently, the central delta activity increases.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized and very attenuated background. 
FIRDA and arrhythmic delta activity.
	
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is non-specific, but is suggestive of a severe cerebral dysfunction.  It can be seen in patients with a toxic or metabolic or infectious encephalopathy.  No seizures were recorded in this tracing.
