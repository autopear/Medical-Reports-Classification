	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	The patient is a 74-year-old  woman with hypothyroidism, hypertension, atrial fibrillation admitted July
28, 2007, with a 10 minute tonic-clonic  seizure with prolonged
postictal confusion. She had recurrent syncope since age 20.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Keppra, fentanyl patch, thyroid, Nexium, aspirin, gabapentin.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG was performed in the l9boratory using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1
channel of electrocardiogram.  Photic stimulation was completed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, background EEG is slow with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Herz. There is excess background data. Shifting arrhythmic delta is observed. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a great deal
of muscle and movement artifact in the background. Despite this,
there appears to be a left temporal spike and slow wave complex underlying a great deal of artifact with a phase reversal at T3. As the patient becomes drowsy, intra hemispheric asymmetry is observed with arrhythmic delta more prominent from the left and despite the artifacts, a high amplitude left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complex. Photic stimulation does not
activate the record, however.
	HR: 	50   bPM
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity
identified in wakefulness and early drowsiness, some of which is discrete and other is high amplitude.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity observed from the left anterior temporal region, prominent as the patient becomes drowsy.
3. Generalized background slowing with slowing of the alpha rhythm.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG suggests a structural functional abnormality as well as a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The generalized background slowing may be due to the patient's multiple medical problems, postictal state or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. No seizures were recorded.
