CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old ambidextrous woman with new onset seizures, 
evaluate for subclinical status epilepticus. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lovenox, Zosyn, Vancomycin, Synthroid, Protonix 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has a lot of muscle 
and movement artifact. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal. There is slow 
background with generous beta and theta. There are occasional sharp waves noted in 
the right hemisphere at FS and T2. The sharp waves are nearly isoelectric at T4. There 
are notable features when the muscle activity drops out and includes at times, a drop 
out at faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere compared to the left although this 
is an intermittent finding. The patient has brief. epochs of stage II sleep. 
HR: 96 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. High amplitude relatively frequent and in fact nearly continuous right temporal 
sharp waves. 
2. Generalized background slowing. 
3. Shifting slowing with sometimes a dropout of faster frequency activity in the right 
temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG continues to 
demonstrate a very irritative focus in the right hemisphere.
