CLINICAL HISTORY:  81 year old woman status post prolonged hospitalization  for intracerebral hemorrhage. Poorly responsive state.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Insulin, Digoxin, Bumex, Hydralazine, Ambien, Ciprofloxacin, Lasix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a mixed frequency pattern as well as generous muscle artifact. Th'e primary frequencies  in the background include theta and some alpha frequency activity, but there is also some delta. There is little in the way of a well defined alpha rhythm, but there is a little bit more alpha frequency activity observed in the left hemisphere in comparison to the right. The individual has eye movement artifact throughout the record, although she does not seem to be interactive. Tactile stimulation is performed during what seems to be the awake state and does not activate the record. The eye movements continue. There are rare sharp waves identified in the left frontocentral region.
	HR: 	84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Background slowing.
	2. 	Asymmetry.
	3. 	More alpha frequency activity on the left, but without really well defined alpha rhythm.
	4. 	Rare sharp waves in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a chronic diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. Some features in this record suggest that the right hemisphere is more significantly impaired, other features including the disruption of alpha frequency on the right suggest that the left hemisphere is the better preserved hemisphere. No seizures were recorded. The patient's lack of reactivity of this overall pattern is perhaps the most significant finding following CNS insult.
