CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 72-year-old male found unconscious and then subsequently had a five-minute seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as poorly interactive.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage with diffuse beta and smaller amounts of theta and delta.  There is occasional frontally predominant delta and a very subtle underlying right frontal sharp wave complex.  Stimulation of the patient elicits an arousal with an increase in beta and muscle, as well as a small amount of alpha frequency activity.  There is variability in the record, and when the patient is not stimulated, there is a decrease in muscle as well as an increase in delta.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a pattern primarily of beta and smaller amounts of delta.
Subtle, right frontal sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This patientâ€™s medications may play a role in the background described above.  Consideration for a localization-related mechanism for seizures is appropriate.
