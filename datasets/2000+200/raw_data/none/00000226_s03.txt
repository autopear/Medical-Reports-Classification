CLINICAL HISTORY:  83 year old female with dementia presenting unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS: Amoxicillin, Nexium, Metoprolol, Heparin, ASA, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-
20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is a 48-hour study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   At the start of this recording, a low voltage slow background is seen, mostly in the theta range at 4-5 hertz. EKG artifact continues throughout the record as well as continued electrode artifact at the F7 electrode. As the record continues on February 23, 2009, the patient becomes drowsy and there is further slowing in the background, with attenuations lasting 1-3 seconds in duration. The lights are initially out on the video, but, by the end of the first day, the lights were back on. Triphasic waves are also seen
Â· midway through this recording. There is a segment on February 23, 2009, at 1633, where impedance is evaluated and the leads are not reading.
On February 24, 2009, the record is now of a higher voltage with continued slowing in the background and attenuation seen on drowsiness of the patient. There is continued slow background with triphasic waves, and sometimes sharply contoured delta are seen in the frontal regions.  This becomes difficult to evaluate with the continuation of the electrode artifact in the F7 distribution.
	HR: 	120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Generalized background slowing in the theta range.
	2. 	Attenuation of the background with drowsiness.
	3. 	Triphasic waves.
	4. 	Sharply contoured waves in the frontal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG shows a waxing and waning pattern of slowing, attenuations, triphasics and sharp waves.  This record is consistent with a diffuse cerebral dysfunction of the patient.  No seizures were recorded during this long-term monitoring.
