CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old woman status post anoxic arrest approximately 36 hours prior to tile EEG. History of severe heart failure at this time. The patient was experiencing twitching of the chin one day prior to the EEG and is now intubated comatose with cerebral edema and weak brain stem signs, pinpoint pupils. 
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Albuterol, Chlorhexidine, Zosyn, Labetalol, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is examined during the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intermittently discontinuous pattern. The cerebral activity when present, includes a pattern of sharply contoured theta, some alpha frequency activity, and some delta. Suppressions are observed and are typically short in duration. There are some sharply contoured wave forms in the left frontocentral and right central temporal regions seen independently. Stimulation of the patient does not activate record. 
HR: 132 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing.
2. Intermittently discontinuous pattern. 
3. Intermittent sharp waves identified from the right centrotemporal lower left 
frontocentral region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were observed during the EEG and the facial twitching previously described was not recorded. This EEG carries a worrisome prognosis for an individual following cardiac arrest.
