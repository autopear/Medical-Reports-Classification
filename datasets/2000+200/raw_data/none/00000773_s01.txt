CLINICAL HISTORY: 83-year-old woman found unresponsive with a left intraventricular hemorrhage status post ventriculostomy, evaluated for seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Mannitol, Moxifloxacin, Insulin, Dilantin
 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. The overall background is slow with a mixture of theta, beta and delta. There was shifting asymmetries but there were superimposed focal slowing with arrhythmic delta activity on the left with a phase reversal at T1. In addition, there are independent right posterior temporal sharp waves observed with a field of spread that is anterior in the posterior temporal region. There is a left central parietal sharp wave also picked up in this record. As the recording continues, the major area of concern is arrhythmic delta with sharply contoured delta with a phase reversal at T1. The other areas of epileptic form activity are much less prominent. Variability is observed in the record with varying quantities of theta and beta. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Â· Arrhythmic delta activity from the left hemisphere, maximum in the temporal region with sharply contoured delta. 
2. Left temporal sharp waves. 
3. Additional, less frequent, epileptic form activity identified at other localizations including right occipital and right central parietal. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded in this highly epileptogenic record for this poorly responsive patient, additional recording may be valuable.
