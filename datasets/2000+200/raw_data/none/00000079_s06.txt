	CLINICAL  HISTORY:	This is  a 47-year-old with refractory  epilepsy and epileptic drug noncompliance, substance  abuse,  hepatitis C, status post  gunshot wound  to the head, multiple surgeries,  bilateral lower extremity  amputation and recurrent hospitalization for problems including seizures,  status  epilepticus,  sepsis and other  problems.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin,Levetiracetarn,Prednisone  and others
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital  video EEG  is performed in the lab using the standard  1020 system of electrode placement with  1  channel of EKG.   The patient has a bur hole in the right frontal region.
	DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  RECORD:	The background  EEG demonstrates  a somewhat slow pattern but he is  awake.  There  is  a discernible outflow rhythm. Artifact is  identified  and there is a breech  rhythm identified in the right  frontal  region. There is some right frontal delta,  a suggestion of  sharp  waves and the right hemisphere demonstrates  more disruption
of faster  frequency activity in comparison to the  left. There is
occasional bifrontal  slowing seen. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.   Photic stimulation  produces a great deal of artifact but there is a bilateral  driving response.
HR:   72  bpm
	IMPRESSION:	Abnormal  EEG due  to:
	1. 	Modest background  slowing.
	2.	Right greater  than left frontal delta with suspicious underlying right  frontal sharp waves.
	CLINICAL   CORRELATION:	This is EEG  is markedly  improved compared to the    others when  the patient  has been hospitalized in coma with  sepsis. This  may be the  most awake and alert EEG  that we  have seen for  this individual  dating  back to  2005.   No seizures  were recorded.
