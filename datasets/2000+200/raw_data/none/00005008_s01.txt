INTRODUCTION: 
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with EKG and anterior temporal electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep stage 1 was recorded. Activation procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
None. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Ativan, vancomycin, folic acid and heparin. 
HISTORY: 
45-year-old man with new onset seizures witnessed by family and delirium with past medical history of hypertension, mental illness, hepatitis C, depression, bipolar disease, IV drug abuse and heroin. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts. There is an increased amount of theta activity seen diffusely throughout the record at a frequency of 15 to 25 Hz. Stage I sleep was seen. Activation procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Focal slow waves present at T3 seen intermittently at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude 20 to 60 microvolts. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to intermittent left mid-temporal delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals evidence of left mid-temporal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen. The increased beta is most commonly seen with use of benzodiazepines.
