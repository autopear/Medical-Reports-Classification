CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year-old male with left thalamic hemorrhage, ventriculitis,
right hemiparesis, but with an episode of left sided tremulousness. The patient was 
reactive with semi-purposeful movements during the episode of tremulousness. 
MEDICATIONS: Cefepime, Nicardipine, Pantoprazole, Lorazepam, Norvasc, Labetalol, 
Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Simiment 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake record in an 
individual who was restless. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is disorganized with primarily a 
theta frequency pattern with shifting arrhythmic delta activity. There is a bit more 
arrhythmic delta activity from the left temporal region with some sharply contoured delta 
in that area. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slow, disorganized pattern. 
2. Occasional superimposed, sharply contoured delta from the left. 
CLINICAL In this individual with a diagnosis of basal ganglia 
hemorrhage, ventriculitis and multiple toxic and metabolic conditions, this EEG is more 
compatible with a diffuse rather than a focal feature. No seizures were recorded.
