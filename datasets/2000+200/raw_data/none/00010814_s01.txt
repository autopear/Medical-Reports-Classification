CLINICAL HISTORY:  44-year-old woman status post cardiac arrest on 4/14/08 date lasting 15 minutes, developed facial twitching earlier today. Patient may have had multiple cardiac arrests.MEDICATIONS: Ativan, NitroglycerinI NTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.The patient has tachycardia and temp of 101.3. She is comatose and intubated.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is remarkable for significant EKG artifact. Sweat artifact is also observed. Otherwise the background is low voltage and suppressed. Stimulation of the patient produces tactile artifact. No motor behaving were observed.HR:	120 to 150 bpmIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:1. Marked background suppression.2. Absence of reactivity or variability.CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. The background slowing and absence of reactivity are worrisome prognoses. It would be helpful to know the time of cardiac arrest. No seizures nor epileptiform activity was seen.
