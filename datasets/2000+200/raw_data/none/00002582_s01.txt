CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 27-year-old male status-post evacuation of an epidural hematoma twelve days ago (6/17/06) with staff pneumonia, now with declining mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Keppra, Nexium, Vancomycin, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The location of the patient’s craniotomy is on the right.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is markedly agitated and moving about throughout the record, even with administration of morphine.  In the brief portions of the record when the patient is cooperative, the background EEG is abnormal with a mixed frequency background, rich in faster frequencies but also theta and delta.  Underlying the movement, there is focality with arrhythmic delta from the right hemisphere and a suggestion of right centrotemporal sharp waves.  
HR:  104 to 120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
	Generalized background slowing.
	Superimposed focal slowing.
	Likely sharp waves from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  The overall background is congruent with the patient’s behavior recorded by the video.  If further characterization of potential epileptiform activity is seen, a repeat study when he is cooperative is recommended.
