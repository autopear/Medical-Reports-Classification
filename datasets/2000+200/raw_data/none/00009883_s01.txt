CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 73-year-old male with esophageal cancer and newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer.  Patient with new onset generalized tonic-clonic seizure on February 23.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and ventilator dependent. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is poorly organized with symmetric, continuous, and diffusely slow of theta and delta activity with a mixed frequency pattern.  Occasionally, shifting arrhythmic delta activity is seen.  Throughout much of the record, the patient is asleep.  Sleep is characterized by a mixed frequency pattern as well as spindles.  Spontaneous arousals occurred with increased theta activity.  Stimulation of the patient produced an increase in slow alpha activity of 8 Hz and increased the theta activity.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized background with diffuse slowing.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates a non-specific pattern, which can be seen in patients with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or in a postictal phase.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG in the lab when the patient is extubated and more awake and cooperative may be helpful.
