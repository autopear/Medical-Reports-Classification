CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old right-handed male status post anoxic encephalopathy, complex medical and psychiatric history. Now with occasional twitching, weak brain stem signs and withdrawal of the right arm. 
MEDICATIONS: Zosyn, Depakote 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, continuous pattern with eye flutter. In addition, there is a low voltage, slow, periodic complex out of the right hemisphere maximum in the right anterior temporal electrode, T2 but with a generous field of spread. This is not continuous. It waxes and wanes but does not build up. When this low voltage, periodic complex is absent, the overall pattern is one of low voltage theta. Towards the close of the record, there is also some artifact observed in the same right temporal region. Stimulation of the patient does seem to produce a scant amount of theta. 
HR: 80 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, slow pattern. 
2. Slow, occasional right periodic complexes in the right temporal region with a generous field of spread. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a relatively severe underlying encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded and although there are some periodic complexes, the activity described above does not involve any of them.
