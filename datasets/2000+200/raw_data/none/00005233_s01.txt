CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year-old woman, status post 4 mg of morphine, 3 mg of 
Haldol with subdural hematoma in March 2008, now with follow up CAT scan showing 
acute blood in the context of left chronic subdural hematoma, bilateral bur holes. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Codeine, Gentamicin, Acetaminophen 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as 
extremely agitated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly slow with primarily a 
theta delta frequency pattern. There are bursts of rhythmic theta or delta from either 
hemisphere, some with a left occipital, more sharply contoured morphology. When the 
patient is allowed to rest, the EEG becomes slightly discontinuous. 
There are rare periodic sharp waves observed from the left. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
2. A handful of sharply contoured morphologies including right occipital and left 
frontal. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. If the patient's behaviors are 
thought to be epileptic in nature, additional recording may be considered.
