CLINICAL HISTORY: A 66-year-old male evaluated 9 September 2007 for generalized 
seizures during sleep. Patient is awake for this event. History of diabetes, hypertension, 
and 2 previous EEGs, one for episodes of aphasia and drooling in October 2005 and a 
previous in September 2005 for a left subdural hematoma with recurrent episodes of 
facial drooling, twisting, disorientation, and aphasia. 
MEDICATIONS: Protoniz, Asa, Insulin, Metformin, glipizide, Tegretol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm 
identified bilaterally. There is arrhythmic delta activity identified in the left temporal 
region, more significant than the right. There is wicket activity, but there is also clear 
sharply contoured delta in that region. Hyperventilation was performed early in the 
record, clearly accentuating sharply contoured delta in that region. Later in 
hyperventilation bursts of rhythmic high amplitude generalized delta are observed. 
As the patient becomes drowsy again sharply contoured delta is identified with a T3 
maximum. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. 
HR: 65 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Sharply contoured delta in the left temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were observed in 2 previous EEGs but are 
clearly more prominent today. While there are no definitive sharp waves, the sharply 
contoured delta is quite prominent. No seizures were recorded.
