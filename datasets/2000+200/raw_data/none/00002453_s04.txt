CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old with schizophrenia, leg fracture, and hypertensive encephalopathy. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, ambien, Ativan, Lovenox, Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a slow, background pattern with arrhythmic delta activity and smaller amounts of theta. The overall pattern is high voltage. There are frontal, triphasic waves, shifting asymmetries and occasional posteriorly predominant sharp waves particularly in the right. The record is continuous. In addition, there are portions of the record with arousal where the triphasic waves disappear as do the sharp waves. Other foci for sharp activity include the right frontotemporal region. 
HR: 80 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. A markedly slow background. 
2. Triphasic waves. 
3. Posteriorly predominant sharp waves. 
4. Sharp waves in other areas including right frontotemporal. 
5. Left frontotemporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. The variability and reactivity as well as the lack of continuous epileptiform activity or periodic sharp waves represents improvement.
