CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest associated with seizures.  Patient now has spontaneous respirations and over breathes the ventilator.  The onset of this patientâ€™s neurologic problems began on 3/27/06.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan 12 mg, Phenobarbital, and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is stimulated during the EEG. A portion of the record was recorded using alternative montages including double distance electrodes, which does not really accentuate the activity on the right, but rather seems to just increase the ICU artifact.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This bedside portable ICU EEG is technically quite challenging, but there is cerebral activity.  The pattern is low voltage, full of EKG artifact, but there is some low voltage mixed frequency theta with smaller amounts of beta seen more prominently from the left than the right.  Stimulation of the patient seems to produce some mixed theta and delta from the left hemisphere. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a nearly suppressed pattern on the right.
Low voltage, but mixed frequency pattern on the left, which is slow but does demonstrate reactivity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  Correlation with imaging and clinical exam are important given the suppression noted on the right.
