CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old male with a subdural hematoma and seizure yesterday. 

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Labetalol, Famotidine, Ancef, Zofran, Cefazolin. 

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient had a craniotomy and recent surgery the day before. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with periodic sharp waves in the right and centrotemporal region. These have a generous field of spread. They are high amplitude. Despite the periodic sharp waves and the slow background, there are no seizures noted. The seizure detector identifies muscle during arousals but no seizures. 

HR: 96 bpm 

LONG TERM MONITORING - 10-125 - 11/03/2010 

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Ongoing sharp waves are noted from the right central parietal region in a background that is quite slow. Some sections of the record support perhaps a sleep pattern with additional background slowing. The sharp waves are becoming broader in morphology and less spiky appearing. 

The EEG recording on November 3, 2010 continues to demonstrate a C4 sharp wave, which is nearly continuous. At times this has a spike like appearance. The periodicity is approximately 1 every 1-2 seconds. There is a little frequency evolution at 10:43 for this, but no clear evolution. Muscle artifact Is observed intermittently in the record. 

HR: 84-120 bpm and irregular 

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent C4 sharp wave 

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports an epileptiform focus on the right.
