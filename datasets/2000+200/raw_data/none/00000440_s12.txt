CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old male with 2 tonic-clonic seizures today, less than 30 
seconds. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Trileptal, Folate, Ativan, Clonazepan 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed today. No seizures are recorded during the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is awake. The 
background EEG includes a pattern with excess beta and theta. The technologist tests 
for mu rhythm in the central regions and identifies a mu activity. In this sharply 
contoured background, there is a suggestion of a right posterior temporal sharp wave 
focus noted in hyperventilation. Additional features of hyperventilation include bursts of 
rhythmic frontal delta. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation 
seems to elicit a driving response. 
HR: 100 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Excess theta. 
3. Right posterior temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background theta and beta described above may be 
due to postictal state and medications. There is a subtle T6 focus not remarkably well 
defined. These findings are similar to previous studies.
