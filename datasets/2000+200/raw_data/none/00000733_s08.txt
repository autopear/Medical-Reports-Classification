CLINICAL HISTORY: 58-year-old woman with neurosarcoidosis, refractory status 
epilepticus and left arm twitching on the 17th. This occurred after abrupt reduction in 
phenobarbital. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenobarbital 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is observed to have 
oral movement. The camera is on the right rather than the left side of the body. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a markedly 
diffusely slow pattern with rhythmic theta. There is some slow, periodic activity poorly 
formed in th-e left hemisphere. Intermittent arousals are associated with an increase in 
theta bilaterally. There are a handful of triphasic waves observed in the record. Rare 
right occipital sharp waves are also noted. 
HR: 100 bpm Occasional PVCs. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slow background alternating with a featureless delta versus theta. 
2. Occasional triphasic waves. 
3. Occasional right sharp waves and left central periodic discharges. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant, underlying 
encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded today. Epileptiform activity was seen from 
either hemisphere.
