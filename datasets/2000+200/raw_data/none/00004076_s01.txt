CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old male, focal seizures following stroke. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is a practice push button, but no clinical events were noted prior to removal of the electrodes around 3:00a.m. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized from the right hemisphere although it is a low voltage pattern. There is intermittent slowing from the left hemisphere. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, vertex wave spindles. The focal slowing is seen intermittently in sleep, but is not particularly prominent. There were no epileptiform features identified.
HR: 90 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
I. Intermittent focal slowing from the left hemisphere less prominent as the record continues. 
2. Mild background slowing. 
3. Very slow approximately 0.75 hertz delta seen from the left posterior quadrant. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural process on the left, but no epileptiform features were noted and no seizures were recorded.
