MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Metformin, Lovenox, Pantoprazole,  HCTZ
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EEG.  There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG shows the activities in the right hemisphere are relatively unremarkable, below to medium amplitude with a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm. The left hemisphere demonstrates marked disruption of faster frequency activity with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta.  In addition, there is a very high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes in the left hemisphere with a generous field of spread maximum F-7, T-1. The focal slowing in the left hemisphere is intermittent and some sections of the record do demonstrate some alpha frequency activity. As the recording continues, the patient is increasingly agitated and there is a great deal of muscle artifact. Underneath this, the sharp waves can be identified.
	HR:	96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Rhythmic slowing from the left hemisphere,  nearly continuous.
	2.	High amplitude left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left involving gray and white matter.  The epileptiform activity is also on the left. No seizures were recorded and despite the extreme amount of movement artifacts, epileptiform activity and focal features were well-defined.
