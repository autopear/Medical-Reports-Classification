MEDICATIONS: 
Dilantin, Lopressor, famotidine, vancomycin, Versed, Lovenox, others 
HISTORY: 
63-year-old male w1th a frontal traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, prior seizures 
INTRODUCTION: 
Digital video EEG is performed 1n the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The overall background is markedly slow with a mixture of slow, lower voltage, featureless theta and delta. There is some shifting asymmetry from the right or left. Stimulation, the patient produces a bit more delta. There are some triangular shaped waveforms in the right or left occipital reg1on, which has a characteristic morphology of POSTS. 
Heart rate 104 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to 
1. Slow background 
2. Shifting asymmetry particularly from the right hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
The background slowing may be correlated clinically. The EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. There were no seizures and no epileptiform features.
