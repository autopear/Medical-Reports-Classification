CLINICAL HISTORY :	80 year-old woman transferred from Roxborough Hospital after a left interventricular and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, change in mental status, atrialfibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, COPD, previous stroke in 1999 with expressive aphasia and sleep apnea.MEDICATIONS: Digoxin, Vancomycin, Xalatan, Diltiazem , Glipizide, ZosynINTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as stuporous.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG when the patient is awake is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and delta. There is a subtle interhemispheric asymmetry with a bit more delta at times on the left in comparison to the right. At times there is some sharply contoured delta maximum at T1-F7.  Features of drowsiness included increase in background slowing. By the close of the record, there is a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm in the theta frequency observed.HR:	96 bpm, Irregular IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:1. Background slowing.2. Shifting slowing.CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance with a bit more involvement of subcortical structures on the left in comparison to the right. No seizures nor definitive sharp waves were observed.
