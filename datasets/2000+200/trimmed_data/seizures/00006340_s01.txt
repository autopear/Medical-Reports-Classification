MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video  EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient had two seizures just before the technologist turns on the EEG machine. This was a 24 hour study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In  wakefulness the background EEG is actually quite well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, a small amount of background theta. Features of sleep include rhythmic central theta.  Vertex waves and posts are observed in stage I sleep.
Seizure #1:  The patient is awake at 10:46.   He starts to shift about in the covers at
10:40:56 and trouble with his right hand. This seizure is characterized by involuntary prolonged clonic and circular movements of the right arm with characteristic frequency evolution an  right face and eye deviation.
	The  EEG during this seizure is quite challenging.	There is paroxysmally evolving muscle artifact but this seems to be intermittent rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity which does evolve out of the left central region. This seizure ends with some postictal increase in beta but the patient is otherwise conversant.
Seizure #2:  Time 11:14: The patient is resting in bed.  He shifts as if he is looking for the pushbutton monitor but he does not find it.
The first EEG changes are characterized by theta picked up in the left central region but with some spread to the right. This demonstrates characteristic frequency evolution as the patient develops tonic movements of the arm and the frequency increases to 5-7
Hz.  It ends abruptly and an alpha rhythm is seen although there is some ongoing
rhythmic theta in the left central region.
HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Two electrographic seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This  EEG is remarkable for a paucity of epileptiform activity interictally. Relatively normal sleep/wake cycles were otherwise identified.
