MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Bactrim 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient received 2 mg of 
Ativan during the EEG. There is very little testing of the patient during the EEG, but he 
is laying with eyes open, motionless in the bed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a lower voltage, 
slow pattern with delta and theta. The most prominent features in this record are high 
amplitude sharp wave spike or polyspike maximum in the right posterior quadrant with 
some variability, sometimes P4 or 02 maximum, sometimes T6. In addition, recurrent 
seizures are characterized by rhythmic repetitive theta frequency activity and repetitive 
spike activity with frequency evolution. The seizures terminate abruptly. Seizure 
duration is 1 minute 40 seconds to 40 seconds in duration. As the recording continues, 
the seizures start to merge into a less discreet pattern. 
HR: 109 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Status epilepticus with a pattern maximum in the right posterior temporal region. 
LONG TERM MONITORING 11/24-28/2010 EEG LTM 10-135 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage 
slow pattern on the left. The right hemisphere has bursts of polyspike activity from the 
right central and parietal region. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. In the 
initial section of the record at 4:06, the bursts continue to build up, wax and wane. By 
5:01 p.m., interestingly, the EEG is more continuous and the bursts are disappearing. 
By 6:41, the EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern. Despite the use of a Versed 
drip over the course of the night, intermittent rhythmic seizures are observed typically in 
the right central parietal region. The EEG also varies a bit in terms of a burst
