58 year old woman with confusion found to have hypocalcemia 
INTRODUCTION: EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
1 channel of EKG. 
system of electrode 
The background EEG is poorly organized with 
theta. In addition, there is paroxysmal, bilateral slowing. 
Superimposed upon there is intermittent focal slowing from the left temporal region 
and there are a 
of well-defined anterior temporal sharp waves. Features of 
stage I sleep waves and spindles as well as posts. In stage II sleep, the 
focal slowing from left temporal region is less remarkable but the sharp waves can 
be seen in and out the arousal in sleep. Left temporal wicket is also identified but the 
sharp waves are with after going slow waves. Toward the close of the 
record, the patient Is little bit more awake with a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 H2:. 
HR: 50bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal 
1. Generalized slowing 
2. Intermittent bursts of generalized paroxysmal slowing. 
3. Left temporal slowing. 
4. Left anterior sharp waves. 
No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a diffuse 
a focal or structural process on the left and potentially 
an epileptogenic Clinical evaluation and correlation with imaging may be 
valuable.
