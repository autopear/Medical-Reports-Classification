INTRODUCTION: 
PROCEDURE NOTE 
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and 
EKG electrodes. No procedures were performed. The patient was lethargic. No normal sleep was recorded. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Albuterol, Zosyn, pantoprazole, and aspirin. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to a diffusely slow background in the 5 to 7 Hz frequency with an amplitude of about 20 to 50 microvolts 
with some fronto-central muscle artifact seen. There is additional bursts of FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta). 
With stimulation, there appears to be a mild improvement in the EEG with some reactivity and increasing the frequencies 
to about 6 to 8Hz. This will quickly return into the theta-delta pattern seen at the beginning of the recording. There is no 
focal slowing seen and no epileptiform activity is seen. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Generalized slow wave and FIRDA. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to diffuse slow waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology and may be in part 
due to medication effect. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
