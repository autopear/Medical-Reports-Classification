MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Depakene, Bromocriptine, Ancef.
REASON FOR EEG:  Tremor
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single EKG electrode.  The patient was unresponsive during the test.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some continuous right temporalis muscle artifact seen.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mixed frequency delta beta background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and 20-50 mV amplitude.
During the recording technician causes noxious stimuli to the patient and there is no clear change in the frequency of the recording. 
HR:    240 bpm, at times slightly irregular. 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
