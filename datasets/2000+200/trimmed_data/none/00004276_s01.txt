PROCEDURE NOTE 
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep were recorded. Photic stimulation was performed. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
Intermittent T3 electrode artifact. 
MEDICATIONS: 
None. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The EEG opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10Hz at 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude. There is well-formed 
normal amount of frontal central beta seen. Sleep is characterized by stage 1. Activation procedures with photic 
stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
None. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Normal awake and sleep EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This is a normal awake and sleep EEG. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
