MEDICATIONS: Verapamil, Dilantin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is modestly slow with a posterior dominant rhythm of 6 to 7 Hz, 30 V.  There are occasional bursts of arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere, particularly in the centrotemporal regions.  These are occasionally associated with drop-out of faster frequency on the right. 
HR:  90 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing for a subject of this age.
Superimposed right focal delta with disruption of faster frequency activity in that region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports the diffuse disorder of cerebral function, as well as an underlying structural or functional abnormality on the right with impact to the white matter. No epileptiform activity and no seizures were seen.
