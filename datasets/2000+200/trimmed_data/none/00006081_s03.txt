	MEDICATIONS: 	Midazolam, Lopressor, Depakene and levetiracetam.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel electrocardiogram. The patient is in a hared collar. His sedative hypnotic medications have been modified but there is no information regarding the current titration or dose rate of his midazolam.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	The background EEG does demonstrate
a cerebral pattern. Some portions are rich in data and those are the relatively low voltage sections. These demonstrate a bit
more theta. There is no indication that there is a difference in the initial portion of the record with a bit more theta and the later portion with a bit more beta in terms of increasing or decreasing the midazolam drip. Very slow eye rolling movements are identified. Stimulation of the patient appears to increase the theta.
HR: 96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal electroencephalogram due to: Replacement of normal background with alternating very low voltage theta and low voltage beta.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a severe central nervous system disturbance. Medications may play a role in the pattern described above. If the variability in the record is of unclear significance without additional medical information but variability is considered a favorable finding in an EEG, however, the pattern seen above may just be an epiphenomenon of
medication. No seizures were recorded. No epileptiform features were seen. Additional  record as CNS medications are reduced may
be helpful to evaluate cerebral function.
