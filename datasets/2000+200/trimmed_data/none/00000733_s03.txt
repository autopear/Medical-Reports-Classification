MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenobarbital, Trileptal. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation were not performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness the EEG demonstrated 
disorganized, generalized, intermittent, arrhythmic delta activity, more on the temporal 
area and more on the right side than the left side. Drowsiness is characterized by 
increasing slowing, decreasing eye movements and also rare bursts of left periodic 
sharp complexes were observed. A lot of shifting asymmetry were also observed during 
drowsiness. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal ..EG due to: 
1. Generalized and disorganized slowing. 
2. Left periodic sharp complex. 
3. Shift slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG may indicate underlying metabolic 
encephalopathy or fluctuation secondary to central nervous system infection. This 
pathologic process may involve the left hemisphere. No seizures recorded.
