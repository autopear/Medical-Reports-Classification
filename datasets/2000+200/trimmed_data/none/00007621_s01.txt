MEDICATIONS: Depakene, Lamotrigine, Omeprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. The patient requires some sedation for placement of EEG electrodes. No clinical seizures are noted by the clinical team. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somnolent through most of the 
record. The overall background is markedly abnormal for an adult From the right hemisphere there is low to medium amplitude primarily beta frequency pattern with small amounts of theta and delta. The left hemisphere demonstrates a similar pattern, but there is occasional focal slowing in the left anterior posterior temporal regions. 
No seizures are noted, no sharp waves are reported. 
HR: 60 to 70 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. An abnormal background with absence of the normal developmental wave forms for an adult. 
2. Excess beta. 
3. Occasional slowing from the left hemisphere congruent with the patient's CAT scan. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform activity does appear to be emanating from the right although not all aspects of the field of spread for this activity may be clear in that the motor activity is only on the right in this patient with a left hemiplegia. 
By the end of the recording, midazolam has been initiated and this produces an increase in 11 Hz activity in the background.
