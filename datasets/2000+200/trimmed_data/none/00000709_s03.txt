MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient reported that he had one brief seizure this morning, but could not otherwise describe it.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a definable posterior dominant rhythm of 6 to 7 Hz, 30 uV. Intermittently, this background is disrupted by prominent, rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz higher amplitude slowing without a definitive spike and slow wave complex.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, multifocal spikes are seen including T3, C4/T4, T4 maximum, and PZ.  The PZ spike is seen just prior to photic stimulation.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and appears to increase the rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity in the background.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient appears drowsy and does not elicit driving. Features of sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occipitally predominant 3 to 4 Hz activity.
Multifocal epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a more diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, as well as raising partial or multifocal mechanisms for this patientâ€™s seizures.  No seizures were recorded.  These results are similar to previous studies.
