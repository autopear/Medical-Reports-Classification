REASON FOR STUDY:  Word-finding and memory problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, isosorbide, atorvastatin, Zofran, aspirin, ipratropium, Spiriva, Advair, furosemide, naproxen, amlodipine, gabapentin, meclizine, lisinopril, omeprazole, nitroglycerin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded during mainly sleep and some wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some posterior electrode artifact due to sleep respiration movements and FP9 electrode artifact throughout some of the recordings.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that is only seen for a limited amount of time during wakefulness that appeared to reach 9 Hematochezia.  There is normal frontocentral beta during that time.  Overall, the recording is mainly stage I and stage II sleep, and at one point there was rapid eye movement seen for a short period.  There is photic stimulation performed which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  90.
IMPRESSION:  Normal mainly asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG mainly asleep reveals no abnormal discharges.  No epileptiform activity or seizures were seen.  Please note that the patient fell asleep quickly during the recording, and remained mainly stage II.  At one point, reached REM sleep during this routine recording, which is suggestive of a sleep disorder.  A sleep consultation may be helpful.
