INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is an ill-appearing geriatric on a stretcher.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  In wakefulness, the activity from the right is somewhat slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm of 8 Hz.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant slowing with arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere, more prominent in the posterior quadrant with intermittent bursts of delta in that region.  The patient is relatively agitated, moving about.  In this challenging EEG, there appears to be a sharp wave at T5.  There is also a rare left mid anterior temporal sharp wave at T1.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity and an increase in slowing followed by spontaneous arousal and blinking. Photic stimulation is remarkable for both photic driving in the right hemisphere, not the left, as well as some photoelectric artifact.   
HR:    54 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing. 
Disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing in the left hemisphere most prominent in the left posterior quadrant.
Sharp waves from the left, particularly T5 but also T1.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the left involving gray and white matter.  The sharp waves are in the region of this patient's previous stroke, similar, if not better than priors.  No seizures were recorded.
