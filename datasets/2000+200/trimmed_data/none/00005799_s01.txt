INTRODUCTION: 
A routine EEG was performed using 1 0/20 standard electrode placement system with EKG electrodes as well as anterior 
temporal electrode. The patient was awake and obtunded, and sleep was recorded. Photic stimulation was performed, 
but no hyperventilation. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Furosemide, hydralazine, Aggrenox, Digoxin, Tylenol, amlodipine, simvastatin, and carbamazepine. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
None. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to diffusely slow background in the theta frequencies with a posterior dominant rhythm at best seen of 7 
Hz and 20 to 50 microvolts amplitude. There is minimal frontal central beta. There appears to be state change in the 
record, but no normal sleep architecture is seen. Photic stimulation was performed and no abnormal discharges were 
seen. No hyperventilation is performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Diffuse slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz seen continuously over the recording with additional frontal intermittent rhythmic delta 
(FIRDA) in bursts seen multiple times during the recording. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to diffuse slow waves and FIRDA. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
