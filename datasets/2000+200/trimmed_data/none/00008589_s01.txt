INTRODUCTION: 
Routine EEG performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
Increased movement and muscle artifact. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The recording reveals a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 30 microvolts, which react symmetrically to eye opening. There is also frontocentral beta rhythm of 15 to 25 Hz and less than 15 microvolts in amplitude seen in moderate amount in the frontocentral region. Sleep is captured in the recording with stages I and drowsiness. No photic or hyperventilation is performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
1. Generalized slow waves are present in the 5 to 8 Hz and 20 to 75 microvolt amplitude ranges seen in the wakefulness. 
2. Seizures: None 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to generalized slow waves, mild. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG is consistent with mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
