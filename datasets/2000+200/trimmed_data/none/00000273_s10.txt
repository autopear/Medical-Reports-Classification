	MEDICATIONS: 	Plavix, Heparin, Labetalol, Depakote,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. The patient is agitated and moving throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Although there is a significant  amount of muscle and movement artifact, the patient is cooperative throughout at least limited portions of the record. The background EEG includes a pattern of primarily theta. Occasional periodic sharp waves are seen in the left hemisphere with a generous field of spreading including T3, T5, and left frontocentral. There is a dynamic pattern with some portions of the record better organized than others. Arrhythmic delta activity is seen on the left compared to the right. As the recording continues, the right hemisphere is richer in
	alpha and theta frequency activity. HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Frequent sharp waves in the left hemisphere with a generous field of spread.
	2.	Interhemispheric  asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
	CINICIAL CORRELATION:	In comparison the previous studies, the right hemisphere is not nearly as slow. There are no longer periodic sharp waves marching through the left hemisphere. No seizures were recorded.
