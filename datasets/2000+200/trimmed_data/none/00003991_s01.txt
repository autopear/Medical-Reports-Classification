INTRODUCTION: 
Routine EEG was performed using the standard 1 0/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep was recorded. Activation procedures including photic stimulation were performed, but no hyperventilation was performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Aspirin, iron, Restoril, Flomax, and Imdur. 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES OR TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
None. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
EEG opens up to a diffusely slow background in the theta frequencies with a posterior dominant rhythm, best seen at 8 Hz and amplitude of 20-70 microvolts. Minimal frontocentral beta seen. Stage I sleep is noted. Photic stimulation does not produce any abnormal discharges. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and 20-60 microvolt amplitude. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG awake and sleep due to excessive theta in wakefulness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG is consistent with mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or 
epileptiform discharges were seen.
