TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is no frontocentral beta. The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep electroencephalogram.
