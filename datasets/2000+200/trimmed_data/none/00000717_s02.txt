MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Morphine, Ceftriaxone, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly 
responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a prominent 
breech rhythm with accentuation of faster frequency activity on the left. In addition, 
there is a high amplitude sharp wave with associated fast activity with a generous field 
of spread including T3, C3 and P3. The activity on the right is lower voltage mixed 
frequency in nature. The sharp wave is continuous and on 1 or 2 occasions starts to 
pause but never evolves into a seizure. Tactile stimulation produces an allergic 
response on the right. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent sharply contoured activity or sharp wave on the left with a generous 
field of spread particularly left centrotemporal. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative focus but no seizures 
were recorded.
