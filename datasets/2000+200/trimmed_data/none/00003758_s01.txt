Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The record opens to a low voltage posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage 1.   
Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges. 
Abnormal discharges:  None. 
Heart rate:  90.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
