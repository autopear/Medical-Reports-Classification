MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Keppra, Dilantin, Morphine, Famotidine, Ertapenem, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performedÂ· at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is not intubated and is conversant. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG from the right hemisphere is mildly slow but there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm and some rhythmic 5 Hz beta. The left hemisphere in contrast, demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity particularly from the frontocentral regions, occasional bursts of delta and a handful of sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing from the left frontocentral region. 
2. Generalized background slowing. 
3. Occasional sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is markedly improved. There are no seizures 
and the overall background from both hemispheres is improving.
