MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous  digital video EEG monitoring is performed  in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. No seizures were reported by the patient, clinical team or the nurse.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   March 10 through March 11. In wakefulness background EEG is well organized.  Stage II sleep includes K complexes,  spindles and posts.  Head rocking is seen with artifact at FP3. There is a brief portion with cessation of the record.
	HR: 	60 bpm
Practice push-button events were observed at 16:36 and 08:14. Neither of these were associated with epileptiform  activity.
March 11 through March 12:  No seizures were reported by the patient, computer or clinical team.  Accidental push-button is observed at 05:12 on the 12th.
Random wakefulness  and sleep.
For a significant portion of the recording, there is no EEG data.  EEG data is observed after 1937 and demonstrates a well-defined alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.
HR: 60-82  bpm
LONG-TERM MONITORING MARCH 11 -12,2008
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous  EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard
10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There are 3 pushbutton events at 16:51,20:15 and 07:51. The date of the study is March 12, 2008 to March 13,
2008.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep, much of the waking record includes a 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm, but unfortunately, the patient is extremely active during wakefulness. There are also portions of the waking record where there is greater than anticipated background theta.
Features of drowsiness include background slowing with slow rolling eye movements. Stage 2 sleep is characterized by abundant spindles and posts. The patient is awake frequently at night and seems to be playing either with a cell phone or a remote for the television. There is little in the way of cell phone artifact.
Spike detections are reviewed and include primarily artifact. Push button events:
	1. 	16:51. The patient is sitting at the side of the bed. She is walking around the room.
She seems to have accidentally pushed the alarm when getting into bed. It seems she sat on it.
	2.	Push button time 20:15. The patient is accompanied  by a nurse. This is a practice push button.
	3. 	Push button time 07:51. The patient is accompanied by a nurse. This appears to be a practice push button.
The early morning practice push button, there is a fair amount of artifact picked up primarily on the left.
IMPRESSION:  This  EEG  within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was observed.   No seizures were recorded.   If this individual is thought to have epilepsy, additional recording is advised.
