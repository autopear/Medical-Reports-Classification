MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbitai, Cionazepam 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This was a 24 hour study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant alpha rhythm of 9 Hz at 25 to 30 mV. As the record continues, there is focal slowing in the right temporal region. At times, one can see individual right T2 sharp waves that are seen as the patient begins to enter into stage II sleep. Initially drowsiness was seen with increasing of delta, and then the deeper stages are seen with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles for stage II sleep. There is an increase in spindles seen, and it is when the patient transitions into sleep that these anterior temporal sharp waves are seen. Sometimes sharp waves are seen as single, but they can be also seen as couplets or bursts. They originate in the T2 region, but there is spread and FA and FP2 seen especially in the referential montage. There is an increase of these sharp waves seen at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. during the study. At times during evaluation of the video, the room is dark. There are no seizures recorded. 
HR: 74 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Right temporal slowing. 
2. Sharp waves in the right anterior temple region seen during sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is epileptiform activity seen coming from the right anterior temple region which would be a patient's focus for epilepsy. No seizures were recorded during this section of the long-term monitoring.
