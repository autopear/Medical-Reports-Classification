MEDICATIONS: 
Mannitol. 
INTRODUCTION: 
18 year-old male status post gunshot wound to the head with 
Ativan, Fentanyl, Pentobarbital, Vecuronium, Dilantin, Norepinephrine, 
Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside using standard 
10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This recording begins on April 4, 
2008 and had some unusual features in that there is data April 4, 2008 and April 5, 2008, but it 
is not clear when the record transitions from April 5, 2008 to April 7, 2008. This is basically a 24 
hours record data ends on the 5th. At some point on the night of the 4th, pentobarbital is 
initiated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Initial record is a dynamic pattern. Like the baseline, frontal 
beta activity and high amplitude delta active was observed. There is a portion of the record with 
an increase in theta. This is seen on several occasions where there is a bit more theta in the 
background. At 12:58 pentobarbital is started. As this is titrated up, a burst suppression pattern 
ensues with periods of suppression lasting 1 0-20 seconds and then periods of activity which can 
be symmetric bilaterally or unilateral with shift in asymmetries. Toward the close of the record at 
15:34, the activity is primarily suppressed with a paucity of cerebral activity and with brief bursts 
of cerebral activity and again this pattern of sometimes cerebral activity seen in isolated 
locations. The patient is examined many times during the record and no activation of the record 
is seen following the induction of barbiturate coma. 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
HR: 104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: 
1. 
2. 
Burst suppression pattern elicited with pentobarbital. 
A markedly abnormal study prior to the induction of burst suppression pattern with primarily 
a base and delta pattern although some portions with theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports the severe underlying disturbance of cerebral 
function. No seizures were recorded.
