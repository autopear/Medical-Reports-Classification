MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Topiramate, Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized with superimposed focal slowing characterized by arrhythmic delta activity primarily from the left hemisphere, particularly in the left posterior temporal region. In wakefulness, there are occasional bursts of generalized, frontally predominant delta. 
HR:  125 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized focal slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing maximum in the left temporal region with some sharply contoured delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function, as well as a structural or functional abnormality in the left temporal region. No seizures were recorded.
