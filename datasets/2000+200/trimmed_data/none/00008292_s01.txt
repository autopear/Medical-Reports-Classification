	MEDICATIONS: 	Levetiracetam, Ampicillin, ceftriaxone, Decadron, Retrovirals.
	INTRODUCTION: 	This is an opening digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system with 1 channel of electrode placement. Patient is lethargic.
	DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 	Background EEG in apparent wakefulness demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm which is in the theta frequency range. As the patient drifts off to sleep, more of a mixed theta delta pattern is identified. In addition to triphasic waves, there is a right frontal spike and slow wave complex. There is no mention of a breech rhythm, however, the sleep record demonstrates an increase in amplitude in the frontal regions and the morphology of the epileptiform activity does suggest that there may have been a right frontal craniotomy. The high phasic waves wax and wane throughout the record. There are a handful of other localizations for sharp waves, including the occipital regions. The individual's mental status seems to wax and wane and when he alerts, there is more of a theta pattern and as he drifts off to sleep, the
epileptiform activity and triphasic waves reemerge. Photic stimulation
does not activate the record and does allow him to go off to sleep, again eliciting the triphasic waves and right frontal sharp waves.
	HR: 100 BPM, slightly irregular. IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing
2. Prominent appearance of triphasic waves and drowsiness.
3. Prominent sharp waves, primarily right frontal, but also occipital, seen in drowsiness.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a metabolic encephalopathy as well as the localization of related mechanism for epilepsy. No
previous EEGs were available and no seizures were recorded.
