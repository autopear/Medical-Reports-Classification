MEDICATIONS: Lovenox. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta frequency pattern and shifting arrhythmic delta.  At times, there is a bit more arrhythmic delta in the right posterior quadrant than the left.  There are a handful of sharp waves seen in this record including left centrotemporal and right posteriotemporal. 
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR:  70 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Shifting slowing with a bit more on the right.
Rare sharp waves identified from either hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features may be compared with this patientâ€™s imaging and clinical history.  No seizures were recorded.
