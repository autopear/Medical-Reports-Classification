INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
		DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It  is a mixture of arrhythmic, almost chaotic delta activity with shifting asymmetries.  There is a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant compared to the left and there are sharp waves identified in the left hemisphere, particularly frontocentral, frontotemporal.	Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.	Triphasic waves are observed bilaterally and occasional FIRDA is observed.
	HR:	N/A
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Markedly disorganized and abnormal background.
	2.	Shifting arrhythmic delta activity, more so on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function and correlation with imaging, particularly in regards to focal sharp waves is advised.
