TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10-11 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
