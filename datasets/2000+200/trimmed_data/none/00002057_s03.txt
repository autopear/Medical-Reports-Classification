MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as 
responsive to stimuli.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. It is a 
very slow, featureless pattern. Sharp waves are seen prominently in the record. They 
are most prominent in the left frontal temporal region, but they are also seen 
independently in the right frontal region. Areas of maximum include F7, F8, T4, T5. and 
frontal, left greater than right. These are accompanied by a very slow delta pattern. 
Throughout the record the fossae of epileptiform activity varies, but much of it is in the 
left hemisphere. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta in the 
background. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
2. Prominent epileptiform activity from both hemispheres. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been previously identified for this 
individual. No seizures were recorded.
