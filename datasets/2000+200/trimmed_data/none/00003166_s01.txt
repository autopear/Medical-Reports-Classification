MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, aspirin, hypertensives, and others that the patient could not recall.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a well-formed, 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  In occasional drowsiness there is rhythmic, 3 to 5 Hz activity from the left mid-to-anterior temporal regions. While there is some artifact, there is a subtle sharp wave seen on rare occasions in this region.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a small amount of rhythmic slowing followed by attenuation of the alpha rhythm in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving and photoelectric effect. 
Brief stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Rhythmic left frontotemporal theta activity with suspicious associated sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG differs from the previous studies in that the activity is unilateral in this record and more rhythmic in nature.
