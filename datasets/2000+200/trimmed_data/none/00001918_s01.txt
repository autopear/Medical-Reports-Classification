INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  There is no indication as to the date of the most recent seizure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is a discernible alpha rhythm approximately 6.5-7 Hz, 50 mV. Wicket activity is observed.  Activity is higher amplitude in the right compared to the left, and there is more anterior spread of the alpha and theta frequency activity on the right
in comparison to the left.  Occasional arrhythmia delta can be observed with shifting
asymmetries in the right and left.  In the transition to sleep, there were rare P4 sharp waves observed. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to
	1. 	Background slowing and disorganization.
	2.		Interhemispheric  asymmetry with more prominent spread of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere than the left.
	3. 	Shifting arrhythmia delta.
	4. 	Rare focal sharp waves seen in the frontal region as well as right parietal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   In this individual with extraordinarily refractory epilepsy, in many previous EEG recordings, epileptiform activity has been previously identified in many locations.  This record today represents a relatively well organized pattern for this individual.  No seizures were recorded and no prominent epileptiform  features were seen.
