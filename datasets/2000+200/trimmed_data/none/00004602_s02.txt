MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Keppra, ASA, Fosamax, Nexium. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed but photic 
stimulation was completed. The patient is noted to have a left skull and bifrontal craniotomy 
abnormality. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern 
from the right hemisphere with an 8 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small 
amount of background theta. The left hemisphere demonstrates continuous, arrhythmic delta, a 
breech rhythm and even in the context of a breech rhythm, frequent, high-amplitude left 
temporal sharp waves. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. The focal 
delta increases in amplitude in drowsiness. Sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation does not 
elicit a driving response. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Continuous arrhythmic deltas in the left hemisphere, maximum in the temporal regions. 
2. In the context of a breech rhythm, left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves sometimes 
with the field of spread into the left frontotemporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. The sharp waves are more prominent 
than in 2003.
