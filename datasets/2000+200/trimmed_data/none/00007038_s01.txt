INTRODUCTION: 
Routine EEG with this was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes. Wakefulness and stage I sleep were recorded. No hyperventilation was performed, but photic stimulation was performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Keppra. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
CZ electrode artifact and P3 electrode artifact noted during the recording. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to the posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10Hz and 20-60 microvolts amplitude, which is reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of frontal central beta seen. Stage I is seen. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges. No hyperventilation was performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE: 
There is almost continuous focal slowing at F7/T3 with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude 20 to 50 microvolts. There is also an increased amplitude and frequency consistent with a breach. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to the left anterior temporal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known subdural and craniotomy. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
