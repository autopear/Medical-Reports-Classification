INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy 
record in an agitated patient. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are portions of the record where there is a 
well defined 10 hertz alpha rhythm best defined on the right in comparison to the left. 
Both hemispheres demonstrate some arrhythmic delta activity, but the left hemisphere 
demonstrates most prominent arrhythmic delta activity with occasional high amplitude 
period sharp waves in the region of the patient's previous craniotomy. Features of 
drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant 
bilateral driving. During photo stimulation, there are a handful of left frontal central sharp 
waves observed. 
HR: 60 to 100 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent arrhythmic delta from the left. 
2. Sharp waves from the left hemisphere with variable maximum. 
3. Slowing from either hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality in 
the left hemisphere with epileptiform activity on the left. There .is also shifting slowing on 
the right. No seizures were recorded.
