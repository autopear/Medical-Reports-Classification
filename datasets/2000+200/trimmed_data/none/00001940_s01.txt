MEDICATIONS: 
INTRODUCTION: 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
but is responsive to stimuli. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 
from both hemispheres is slow, disorganized. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. 
Prominent epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere, particularly frontotemporalfrontocentral 
with a generous field of spread. 
2. 
Background slowing, particularly on the right. 
3. 
Periodic delta, right hemisphere 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a highly 
epileptogenic focus. Additional monitoring may be appropriate.
