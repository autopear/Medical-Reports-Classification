MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ASA, Norvase 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient had the previous 
craniotomy from remote brain surgery, and the tech also notes that he has right scalp 
edema. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG includes a mixture of theta, beta, 
and smaller amounts of delta. There is an interhemispheric asymmetry on the right. In 
addition, there is a breech rhythm on the right, but there are occasional high amplitude 
spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complexes from the right with associated 
disruption of faster frequency activity. The patient wakes up spontaneously, and when 
he does so there is an increase in faster frequency in the background. The majority of 
the spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complexes are maximum in the right 
anterior temporal region but demonstrated generous field of spread. 
HR: 110 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a theta frequency pattern, although this is 
a dynamic reactive pattern. 
2. Superimposed focal slowing and sharp waves on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for 
epilepsy congruent with previous brain surgery on the right. No seizures were recorded.
