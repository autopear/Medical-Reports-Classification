REASON FOR STUDY:  EEG to take off Depakote.
MEDICATIONS:  Loperamide, Cymbalta, lisinopril, Pradaxa, Truvada, divalproex, levetiracetam, Kaletra, Haldol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were performed including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The EEG reveals normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produces no abnormal discharges and __________ photic driving at 15 Hz and above.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
