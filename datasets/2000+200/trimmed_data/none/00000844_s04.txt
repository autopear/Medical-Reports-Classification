CLINICAL HISTORY
old woman admitted with hypothermia, change in mental status. 
evaluate for ongoing events
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Atropine, Chlochexidine, lnsulin, Nystatin, Darepoelin, Nexium, 
Isordil, Captopril, Heparin Simvastatin. 
Continuous digital Video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode with 1 channel of EKG. This is a 3-day recording, spanning 2/6 to 2/9. 
Seizure and spike detection is utilized, No clinical seizures are identified by the software.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG over this long-term monitoring is 
relatively stable, good qualify with sharply contoured theta and del a as well as shifting 
arrhythmic delta activity. In this sharp contoured background there are sharp waves including 
a few in the bifrontal mid temporal, and left frontal. Behaviorally, the patient is 
motionless. She is almost in the dark. Some bifrontal sharp waves are also observed. 
HR: 70 bpm 
This 72-hour continuous EEG is remarkable for: 
1.A markedly abnormal an4sharply contoured background including high amplitude sharp contoured theta, with delta. 
2. What may well be a change in state with a bit slower delta activity in the earl 1 a.m. 2 a.m. time slot. 
3. What may be slow wave sleep with increase in delta, observed on occasion.
4. Sharply contoured record sharp waves are identifiable including left frontal, bifrontal and right mid temporal.  
CINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. With little input, the electrodes 
remained in good quality. There were some aspects of morphology to suggest sleep. There are 
also some areas at least initial the EEG was intermittently attenuating as would be 
anticipated in a severe encephalopathy.
