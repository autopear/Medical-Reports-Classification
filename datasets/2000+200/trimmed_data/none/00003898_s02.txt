MEDICATIONS: Depakote, beta blocker, Procardia, Epogen, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake and confused.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is poorly organized and is marked by a fair amount of muscle artifact.  The patient is mumbling, talking, or moving, and at one point she moans “everything hurts so bad,” but no facial twitching is seen.  The background EEG in wakefulness shows variable organization, and at some point there is a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a theta pattern with generous beta.  During other portions of the record, there is more rhythmic delta and the record is a bit slower.  There is also some shifting arrhythmic delta.  In addition to the FIRDA, there is occasional occipitally predominant rhythmic delta.  
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Poor organization.
Occasional FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded, none of the facial twitching was observed or marked, and no epileptiform features were seen.   This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as might be seen in renal failure. These features are non-specific and can be seen in other conditions.
