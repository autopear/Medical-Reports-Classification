MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Atenolol, Carbatrol 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates generous, diffuse beta activity with a rhythmic theta pattern. Superimposed upon this is some focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant. This is at times sharply contoured and it is more of a T4 T6 1ocation. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, left greater than right. Heart rate 80 beats per minute. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Excess theta. 
3. Focal slowing in the right posterior region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG demonstrates dramatic improvement.
