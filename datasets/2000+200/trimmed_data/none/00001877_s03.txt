MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Diazepam, Lamictal, Heparin, Aspirin REASON FOR STUDY: Confusion.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The-patient was awake during the study, but restless, lethargic, and nonÂ­ co	No activating proce	were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: Continuous movement during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The reco	opens to a diff	slow-background with no posterior dominant rhythm and normal fronta central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at the left hemisphere maximal in the F7/T1, at 2-4 Hz:
seen continuously.  In this hemisphere, however, there is a mixture offaster frequencies during the reco
Low amplitude and lack of fa	frequencies over the right hemisphere.
Generaliz:ed slow waves at 2-4 Hz: with intermittent FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activities).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Left hemispheric focal structural dysfunction.
3. possible right hemispheric focal cortical dysfunctioA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence ofleft hemispheric structural dysfunction maximalin the anterior temporalregion with additional possible cortical dysfunction of the right hemisphere. Thereis also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction,whichis nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptifonn discharges were seen.
