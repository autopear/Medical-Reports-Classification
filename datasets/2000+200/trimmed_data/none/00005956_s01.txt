INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using  standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE R ECORD:
The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It is
discontinuous in nature.  In addition, there are sharp waves or spikes with multiple phase reversals including C4, T6, F7.  Some of these are medium amplitude, others are high amplitude, and some are generalized.  They often exceed 200 microvolts and the high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes are associated with suppression of the background, typically of 1 second duration.   Stimulation of the patient does not produce a change in the background EEG. There is some variability in this record with some sections demonstrating a
bit more theta but others demonstrate more significant discontinuity with the epileptiform activity followed by background suppression and then the theta before the high amplitude spike.
	HR: 	150 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Markedly abnormal EEG due to
1. High amplitude periodic spike and slow wave complexes which may be focal in either
hemisphere or generalized
2.   Intermittent background suppression
3.   Markedly abnormal background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study, recorded several days after cardiac arrest, carries a worrisome prognosis, particularly in regard to the presence of epileptiform activity, the discontinuity, and the lack of reactivity.  No seizures were recorded.  Additional observation is advised to make certain that subclinical seizures are not part of this patient's clinical picture.
