I NTRODUCTI ON: Continuous d.igita video EEG was performed a,t beds(de using stan.dard 10- 20 system of electrode placement with 1 channelof EKG. There is no documentation that seizure medications were given,nor that cl nicalevents which suggested seizures were rec:Orded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very suppressed pattern withanintrahemispheric asymmetry. The activity on the rightis low voltag delta and featureless. On the left there is a bit more faster frequency activity andoccasi nal left frontal temporalsharp waves. Some sections of the record,particularly later sections of the record, when the patient was placed ona cooling blanket, demonstrate loss of integrity of the record. This·study runs from January 1'0,2009 to January 12, 2009 at 0905. Due to the poorquality of the·EEG data, any valuable data would be lost by 1900 hours on.January 11, 2009.
	HR:	60-90 bpm
IMPRESSION: AbnormalEEG due to:
			Marked background slowing.	.	.
	An intrahemispheric asymmetry, compatible with a previous craniotomy characterized liy
relat ve suppression of faster frequency activity on the right andoccasional sharp waves on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recordedin any part of thislong tenn monitoring,including a section that followed onthe morning of January 12,2009, however, there  ere technicalIssues in regards to overall quality.·
