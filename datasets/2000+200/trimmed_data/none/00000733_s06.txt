INTRODUCTION: Continuous EEG monitoring is performed at bedside in ICU for an 
individual comatose and intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates essentially 
continuous occipital temporal spiking in the right posterior region with a broad range of 
spread including, the phase reversal is at 02 but T5-01 are involved. 
Later portions of the record are remarkable for some form of muscle artifact in the 
background, but underneath this the occipital spiking persists. 
Over the course of the record there are problems with electrodes, but by 23:07 the 
epileptiform activity seems to be improving. The remainder of the background is difficult 
to discern. 
Throughout the course of this record there are problems with electrodes, but the 
electrodes in the area in question, occipitotemporal region, remain relatively intact. The 
epileptiform activity switches from an almost continuous pattern to one with intermittent 
bursts, for example at 11 :01 on the 19th. 
There is a change in the record at 13:49. No clinical correlates are noted, and actually 
this is at 11 :36. No clinical correlates are noted in terms of a change in the utilization of 
antiepileptic medications or sedative hypnotic medications, but the background is much 
slower than had been previously seen. The right occipital sharp waves at this time are 
typically seen approximately 3 in every 1 0 seconds, with very short build-up into trains. 
This section of the record concludes at 19:55. there is no information provided as to why 
the record was concluded, but that same pattern of occipital sharp waves is observed. 
There is no EEG data from the 1oth to the 20th or the 20th to the 21st. 
from 21 to 22nd 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring using seizure and spike detector 
is recorded in the ICU for a patient who is intubated, but with eye opening and 
occasional spontaneous movements. 
Background EEG includes a slow pattern mixed in frequency with primarily slower theta, 
some alpha frequency activity, and some delta. Infrequent T6-02 sharp waves are 
observed. Some portions of the record are much lighter than others, richer in theta 
frequency activity. This is particularly prominent in the overnight section: 
HR: 102 bpm 
Term from 22nd to 23rd 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous EEG monitoring performed at bedside in the ICU. In this 
section of the record no clinical history is provided and no medications are listed. The 
patient is comatose and intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates continuous pattern 
with slower theta and delta activity. Frontal eye movement artifact is observed, as is an 
intermittent right occipital temporal spike. There is clear variability, even in short epochs 
of the record with some sections have more beta and theta, others relatively less. In 
this epoch, January 22 through January 23, there is intermittent spiking in the right 
occipital temporal region. The quality of the electrode integrity varies over the course of 
the night. Despite at times the relatively frequent spiking, there is no build-up in trains, 
no clinical seizures are observed or documented, and no electrographic seizures are 
noted. 
HR: 100 bpm 
from 23rd to 24th 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the ICU. The 
patient is intubated with eye movement. There is no indication as this patient's 
medications or clinical history at this time. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the background EEG 
includes a continuous theta frequency pattern. Intermittent right occipital sharp waves 
are observed. No clinical seizures are observed, simply a mixed pattern of theta, delta, 
and right occipital sharp waves varying in frequency, at some points relatively frequent, 
but overall not continuous. The overall background varies in terms of quantities of theta 
and delta. Frequent eye movement is seen in this record. Technical problems with this 
record include the use of a T1-T2 montage without plugging in those electrodes. 
January 24 through January 25: The patient remains intubated. In this portion of the 
record the background is more a delta with theta pattern. Right occipital sharp waves 
are observed. In addition, there is occasional a bit of fast activity. The overall record is 
variable with some sections of the record demonstrating more theta and others delta. 
The frequency of the right occipital sharp wave varies at times, several in a 1 0-second 
period, at other times as few as 3 in a 1 0-second period. 
By 2200 hours on the 24th, there were problems with electrode integrity. 
The close of this epoch on the 25th includes very poor quality EEG with loss of many of 
the electrodes. The heart rate in this section has slowed to 100 BPM. In the final 
sections of the record no assessment regarding the presence or absence of sharp 
waves can be made. Clinically the patient is comatose and intubated with a slow 
background notable despite the limitations of the electrodes at 8 a.m. 
from 25' 2008 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG recording is performed at bedside in the ICU. 
There are no push buttons, no clinical comments are provided. The patient is in the ICU 
and is poorly responsive 25th through the 26th. As the tracing begins, the background 
EEG is markedly abnormal. The background includes alpha and theta frequency activity 
with sharp activity in the right hemisphere. This activity is variable, but in the initial 
sections of the record is most prominent in the right central parietal region. The activity 
from the left is intermittently discontinuous. As the recording continues there are also 
some more subtle right occipital sharp waves. Over the course of the first 24 hours the 
EEG demonstrates increasing discontinuity, some bilateral periodic activity. The 
recording includes the T1, T2 electrodes in the recording strategy, which are actually 
'not plugged in for this patient. Reformatting the data, particularly after 3 a.m., includes a 
slow pattern with intermittent discontinuity and some vertex waves. There are no clinical 
notes in the EEG regarding changes. Clearly defined vertex waves and later occipital 
sharp waves, better defined in the left than the right, are observed. The patient can be 
viewed on the video. She is unresponsive. 
from 261h to 2th 
No clinical information is provided at this time regarding the patient's medications, 
examination, or other therapies. The background demonstrates a relatively slow pattern. 
As the recording continues, occasional right occipital sharp waves are observed. 
Interaction with clinicians, particularly on the evening of January 26, 2008, at 21:31, 
does not impact the EEG. By the morning of the 27th, there is a bit more rhythmic delta. 
In addition, sharp waves with variable maximum are observed including F3 and left 
frontotemporal and left frontal central as well as independently in the right frontal central 
region. 
Overall in this section of the record the background is improved in that there is less in 
the way of persistent epileptiform activity, but there are epileptiform discharges

INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG recording is performed at bedside in the ICU. Â· 
There are no push buttons, no clinical comments are provided. The patient is in the ICU 
and is poorly responsive 25th through the 26th. As the tracing begins, the background 
EEG is markedly abnormal. The background includes alpha and theta frequency activity 
with sharp activity in the right hemisphere. This activity is variable, but in the initial

slow pattern with intermittent discontinuity and some vertex waves. There are no clinical 
notes in the EEG regarding changes. Clearly defined vertex waves and later occipital 
sharp waves, better defined in the left than the right, are observed. The patient can be 
viewed on the video. She is unresponsive. 
from 261h to 2th 
No clinical information is provided at this time regarding the patient's medications, 
examination, or other therapies. The background demonstrates a relatively slow pattern. 
As the recording continues, occasional right occipital sharp waves are observed. 
Interaction with clinicians, particularly on the evening of January 26, 2008, at 21:31, 
does not impact the EEG. By the morning of the 27th, there is a bit more rhythmic delta. 
In addition, sharp waves with variable maximum are observed including F3 and left 
frontotemporal and left frontal central as well as independently in the right frontal central 
region. 
Overall in this section of the record the background is improved in that there is less in 
the way of persistent epileptiform activity, but there are epileptiform discharges 
observed in this record including left central and independently right central and now left 
posterior temporal. 
from 2ih to 281h 
No clinical notations are provided in this section of the record. there is no information 
regarding changes in medications or changes in this patient's clinical status. In addition, 
this section of the record is intermittently more challenged by electrode artifact. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record is a bit more variable in 
terms of presence or absence of faster theta frequency activity. There seems to be the 
appearance of an epileptiform discharge in the right central region. Unfortunately this 
can be observed on the 27th at 12:35. Unfortunately the quality of the electrode 
placement at that time is suboptimal. Later portions of the record, including 2200 hours, 
include a pattern that is overall improving with theta and variable amounts of delta. By 
the close of this record early in the morning on the 24th when there is somebody at the 
bedside working with the patient at 4 a.m. At that portion of the record, the patient is 
interactive with eye opening and eye closure. Unfortunately the caliber of the electrodes 
is clearly deteriorating at this time, but there is some eye opening. At the close of the 
record between 10 and 11 a.m. on the 28th, the patient is intubated, background EEG is 
continuous with variable amounts of theta and delta. There appears to be a vertex wave 
in the background, but there is also some sharp activity picked up in the left frontal 
region. At the close of the record on the 28th the very prominent right occipital focus 
seems to have resolved. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Recurrent seizures at maximum in the right occipital region. 
2. Intermittently the appearance of focal epileptiform activity from other loci, resolving 
over time. 
3. Background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Little clinical information was provided in terms of the use 
of medications during this very long recording and/or other factors that could have led to 
the intermittent discontinuity or background slowing. Well before the close of the record, 
the background EEG did improve and in fact no seizures were observed from the 21st 
on.
