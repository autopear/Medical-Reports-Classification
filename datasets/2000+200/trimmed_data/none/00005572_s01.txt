MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Valium, and Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient appears to be resting comfortably in the ICU.  Although stimulation is not done until later on in the record, he occasionally moves spontaneously.  The overall pattern appears to be one of wakefulness with generous background beta, a glimpse of a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, and excess background theta.  The patient is moving spontaneously and there are brief portions with a single electrode artifact.  Stimulation of the patient produces a brief arousal with eye opening and elevation of the head, as well as an increase in alpha frequency activity.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Excess beta.
The patient appears to be unable to achieve wakefulness and appears to be somewhat sedated. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The excess beta and a small amount of theta may be related to this patient's medications.  No seizures were recorded.
