MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Risperdal, and Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates generalized background slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 5 Hz and an overall background with theta.  There is subtle intrahemispheric asymmetry with more focal slowing from the right than the left.   The background demonstrates subtle, rare right temporal sharp waves.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record. The overall record does demonstrate some shifting arrhythmic delta activity from the left, but the majority of it is from the right.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  subtle, rare right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is similar to this patientâ€™s previous nine EEGs.  No seizures were recorded.
