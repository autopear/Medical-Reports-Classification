MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Morphine, Ceftriaxone, Protonix.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Subarachnoid seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures which include photic stimulation revealed no discharges.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Intermittent focal slowing at F7/T3 seen at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 QT microvolts.   
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
