INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-
20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no patient log 
provided. There is no indication that the clinical team noted seizures. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is 
somewhat slow. There is arrhythmic delta activity seen in the central regions, 
particularly on the left. This may occur in bursts. There is an underlying transient in the 
left central region. As the patient drifts in and out of stage II sleep, arrhythmic delta is 
observed in the same region. At the close of the recording the arrhythmic delta activity 
is observed on the left. The left central sharp waves are well defined in the sleep 
recording that morning, but are reduced as the patient alerts. 
HR: 48-60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal arrhythmic delta activity most prominent from the left central region. 
2. Left central sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures are recorded, but there is a prominent, 
epileptiform focus observed in this record.
