MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zantac, Diclofenac.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 standard electrode placement and EEG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep study was recorded.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record open to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm, an alpha rhythm of 11 Hz.  There was also noticeable central mu rhythm present.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation increased the amplitude of the record. Sleep: Attenuation of alpha and an increase in theta, vertex waver, POSTS.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURE ACTIVITY:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. A normal EEG does not exclude epilepsy diagnosis.
