INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation are performed. The patient is responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat disorganized with an alpha rhythm typically 9 Hz, but with some variability. A breech rhythm is identified with higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right. In addition, there is a rhythmic mixed theta and delta from the left temporal region with a generous field of spread and accentuation of beta in the frontal regions. As the patient becomes drowsy, the beta accentuation becomes more prominent. Occasional left posterotemporal sharp waves are observed as there are some sharp waves at C3-P3. Features of stages 2 sleep include vertex wave spindles and posts. The left posterior temporal slowing is most prominent when the patient is somewhat drowsy. The sharp waves are also most prominent at that time. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Left temporal focal slowing most prominent left posterior temporal region. 
2. Left posterior temporal sharp waves.
 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be compared to previous studies. No seizures were observed.
