MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and insulin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The awake background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The most striking abnormality in this record is a high amplitude spike and slow wave, poly spike and slow wave complex identified from the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread including C4, P4, and T4.  The focal spiking may be intermittent, periodic, or occur in transient clusters.  When the spiking stops, the posterior dominant rhythm on the right is well defined and there are portions of the record where it is defined bilaterally.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the epileptiform activity becomes increasingly periodic and the EEG develops a small degree of discontinuity in sleep around the epileptiform activity.  
Photic stimulation elicits primarily a photoelectric effect, but there is a suggestion of a driving response underneath that.  
HR:  118 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere with a relatively generous field of spread including the parietal, central, and posterior temporal regions. 
Associated focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a structural abnormality as well as a partial localization method for seizures.
