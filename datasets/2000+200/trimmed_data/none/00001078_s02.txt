MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  No seizures are reported by the patient or the nurses.  There are no push button events.  There are no clinical seizures observed by the nursing staff, patient, or computer.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Wakefulness includes a well organized 10 Hz, 75 V posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient spends much of her time in drowsiness or stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  POSTS are notable both in stage I and stage II sleep. The child is relatively drowsy and in fact is most alert in the evening, spending much of the day in bed a bit drowsy.  
Brief slow wave sleep is identified but not sustained.  Sleep is relatively fragmented.  The audio indicates a noisy background environment.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal 24-hour video EEG monitoring.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Given the background noise and the ER experience, the fragmented sleep may be due to either sleep deficit or an underlying sleep disorder.
