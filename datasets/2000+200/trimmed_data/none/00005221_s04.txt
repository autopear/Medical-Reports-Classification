MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Zofran. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no indication that the patient is having clinical events during this LTM session. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow and disorganized pattern but, of note, in relaxed wakefulness, it is a bit less slow than seen initially in the study done on 10/1612010. Occasional isolated left frontal or central sharp waves are observed. There is less in the way of rhythmic left frontal 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity although this can be seen with brief isolated bursts on the order of a second or two. Sleep is characterized by an increase in background slowing. As the record continues on the afternoon of 10/18/2010, the background is not as slow as previously identified. Sleep sections are associated with an increase in background slowing. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring is remarkable for: 
1. Background slowing is improving. 
2. Rare left frontocentral sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. Additional factors may be important to determine the cause of this patient's ongoing encephalopathy.
