INTRODUCTION: 
An EEG is performed using the 10/20 electrode placement system with an EKG electrode. This is an awake and drowsy record. No activation procedures are used. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Vancomycin and heparin. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
This is a limited EEG due to continuous T3 electrode artifact. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 
This EEG record opens up to an absent posterior dominant alpha rhythm and also beta rhythm. No normal sleep architecture is seen throughout the record. The EEG shows diffuse theta and there is no clear change in the record to stimulation. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Diffuse theta is seen in the record. 
SEIZURES: 
No epileptiform activity seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to diffuse theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology, could be due to 
medication or encephalopathy. No seizures are seen.
