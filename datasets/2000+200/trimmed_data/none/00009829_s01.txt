TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Please note photic stimulation produced no photic driving.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy electroencephalogram.
