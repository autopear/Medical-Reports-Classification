CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed male with past CNS toxoplasmosis, encephalopathy, recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lorazepam, Phenobarbital
 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is noted to have intermittent seizures characterized by eye blinking, grimacing and turning to the right. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins on the afternoon of 10/12/2010, recurrent electrographic seizures are noted which begin with a buzz of fast activity, which is primarily in the left posterior quadrant including T5, 02 and P3. The activity demonstrates more of a generalized buzz and then repetitive sharp waves in the left posterior quadrant including T4, 01 and P3. Typical seizures are 1 to 2 minutes in duration. As the recording begins, brief seizures less than 1 minute are noted at 5:40 p.m. 
The seizures begin to abate overnight and they are not as continuous in the overnight sections of the recording. 
Lacosamide is administered late in the day on 10/12/2010 and in the morning of 10/13/2010. Despite this, there are seizures at 3:40 in the afternoon on 10/13/2010. Although this review ends at 4:48, following the initiation of phenobarbital, the seizures do appear to be slowing. Additional seizures are noted at 3:44. The patient is somewhat drowsy following the administration of phenobarbital. As the recording continues, the eye blinking and clinical features of seizures remain with eye blinking and posturing of the patient's arms. 
HR: 72 bpm. 
LONG TERM MONITORING 10/14/2010 - 10-114 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Occasional clinical seizures are noted by the team. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Electrographic seizures are identified including at 6:07 p.m. The seizures are identical to those seen in the initial section with a buzz of 20 Hz activity which begins in the left occipital region. Using an average reference, this is clearly maximum at T5 and 01. This activity builds up and a beta activity spreads throughout the posterior quadrant on the left and then more diffusely throughout the left hemisphere. It is also picked up in the right occipital region. This is followed by repetitive spike activity, which is maximum in the left occipital region but again has a diffuse representation with frequency evolution noted over the first 30 seconds. Today the seizures abate in the left temporal region but continue a little bit more in the left parietal region and then are followed by background slowing.
 
The seizure detector is a reliable index for this patient and seizures are observed at 6:07 p.m., 7:36, 7:52, 8:05, 8:14, 8:22, 8:30, 8:34, 8:41, 8:49, 8:56, 9:03, 9:09, 9:34, 9:40 and 9:55. At this time, Ativan is given. With the last dose of Ativan, there is a dramatic decrease in the seizures after the 10 p.m. dose. There are seizure markings at 
5 a.m. which are not associated with seizures. 
Recording continues in the morning of 10/14/2010, and at this point, the patient is awake. The background is more of a theta frequency pattern. No additional seizures are noted. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: CLINICAL CORRELATION: This 48 hour long term video EEG monitoring session is characterized by: Complex partial status epilepticus which improves dramatically in the first 24 hours of the record and in the second 24 hours, there are sections in the record with 1 seizure per hour to as many as 8 seizures per hour but with a dramatic decrease after the last dose of Ativan. At present, the patient's status epilepticus appears to have resolved.
