INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. No seizures were reported during this section of the record.  The patient did experience a seizure on the 25th, but the system was not recording at that time.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG continues to demonstrate focal slowing from the right frontotemporal region.  With the use of different montages to accentuate the parasagittal regions, the breach clearly involves the right temporal and centrotemporal regions, and some of the focal slowing is seen bilaterally in the frontal region, more maximum on the right than the left.  Sleep is characterized by an increase in background beta.  A T4 sharp wave can be identified in sleep.  
Long-Term Monitoring, 9/25/04 to 9/26/04
Data from September 25 in the afternoon through September 26 was not retrieved.  This includes a seizure that the patient experienced.  
Long-Term Monitoring, 9/27/04 to 9/28/04
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: No seizures were recorded in this section of the record.  In wakefulness, the background EEG continues to demonstrate a breach rhythm with focal slowing identified from the right frontotemporal region, but at times with spread to the right central and parietal regions.  This can be seen most notably during the sleep section of the record.  The sleep section of the record is remarkable for relatively frequent arousals from sleep.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  The sharply contoured activity at T4, P4 is identified.  This is not as remarkable as seen in some of the earlier sections of the record.  Occasional vertex waves are identified.  
HR:  __ BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This prolonged video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere, particularly the frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.
Sharp waves best identified in sleep, which on some occasions are maximum in the right temporal parietal region and in other cases the right centrotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a localization-related mechanism for this patientâ€™s epilepsy.  To some extent, the field of some of his epileptiform activity is a bit more lateral than the MRI changes.  No seizures were reported in part due to technical problems, but intracranial electrodes may be helpful to actually record and better localize one of his seizures.
