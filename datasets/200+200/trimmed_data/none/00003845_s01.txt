REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage 1.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  A single electrode artifact at T4 intermittently.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges seen.
