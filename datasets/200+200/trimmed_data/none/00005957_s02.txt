INTRODUCTION: During this 24-hour section of the recording, there are multiple practice push buttons, but no seizures are reported by the nurses.  The computerized doppler fails to identify seizures. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  This patientâ€™s antiepileptic drugs were reduced during this section of the record, and this EEG demonstrates less in the way of background theta.
