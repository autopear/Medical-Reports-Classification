MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Depakote, Heparin, Pantoprazole.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient was obtunded during the recording.  
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:   There is continuous diffuse muscle artifact during the entire recording which limits the interpretation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffuse muscle artifact with low amplitude recording with little to no normal cerebral activity seen underneath the muscle artifact. No normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta is seen. As the patient is stimulated, no clear change in the pattern of the EEG is noted. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Low amplitude recording, but no clear cerebral activity seen in the midst of marked muscle artifact. 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
Low amplitude recording in the midst of marked muscle artifact with no clear cerebral activity seen.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with marked cerebral dysfunction and the lack of amplitude implies cortical damage. It is difficult to assess prognosis due to the marked muscle artifact which causes major limitations on the interpretation of this EEG. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
