INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is perfom1ed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow background with a mixture of theta and some faster frequency activity from the left. The right hemisphere includes both theta and some arrhythmic delta activity with a prominent craniotomy pattern with a breach rhytlm1 with some sharply contoured slowing. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing, as well as some frontal delta.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Focal slowing from the 1ight with some sharply contoured delta.
2.   Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.
