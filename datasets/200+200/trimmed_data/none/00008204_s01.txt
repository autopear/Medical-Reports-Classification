MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 9 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  A breach rhythm is identified with occasional focal theta in the right centrotemporal region.  During the record, the patient is awake and is described as unable to talk.  The EEG at this time shows occasional left temporal wicket.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta.  
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excess background theta.
Rare focal slowing from the right frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record and no seizures were recorded. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study in the lab or long-term monitoring could be helpful.
