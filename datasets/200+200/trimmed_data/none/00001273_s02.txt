MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Valproate.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake despite the endotracheal tube and follows commands. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of background beta and a small amount of background theta.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Mild excess theta in wakefulness.
	Mild excess beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  There are some technical limitations of this record including a dysfunctional FP2 and F4 electrode.  Because of these technical issues, a repeat study is unfortunately necessary.
