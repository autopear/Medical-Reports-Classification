INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is  not cooperative and moving about continuously in the initial portion of the record.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background EEG is bilaterally slow, high amplitude, disorganized with more arrhythmic slowing on the right, high amplitude sharp waves, maximum F8, T4, or FP2.  There are also sharp waves seen in the right central temporal region.  As the patient becomes aloof briefly cooperative, bursts of frontal delta higher amplitude on the right compared to the left were observed. As the drowsy pattern continues, more rhythmic theta is observed on the left. A left P3 sharp wave is noted and the intrahemispheric asymmetry with more slowing on the right is observed.  Faster frequency activity in the alpha theta frequency range is noted on the left when the patient sits quietly. The F8 sharp wave in the context of the breech rhythm certainly comes out in drowsiness.   Photic stimulation produces a scant driving response on the left.
HR:   60 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Markedly disorganized pattern.
	2.	lntrahemispheric asymmetry with higher amplitude slow activity on the right.
	3. 	Multifocal sharp waves, particularly right frontal but also left parietal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings have been previously described from this patient. No seizures were recorded.
