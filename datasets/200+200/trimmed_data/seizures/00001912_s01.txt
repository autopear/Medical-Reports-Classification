INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 1 0-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient received a phenytoin load and then 2 mg of Ativan during the study. She is somnolent but arousable, and has a face mask.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Multiple electrocardiographic seizures are observed during this EEG. There is bilateral occipital sharp and slow wave, a repetitive sharp wave activity. With additional montaging, the activity is maximum in the right occipital and posterior temporal
region. The activity waxes and wanes. The phenytoin infusion concludes near the end of the study. Initially, 2 mg of Ativan is given in the last few minutes of the study and this seems to breaking up the repetitive discharges which wax and wane, but are typically under 1  minute in duration. As the recording concludes, the epileptiform activity is becoming less spiky in conformation and the discharges are a little bit more spread out. There is a train of somewhat periodic sharp waves with generous beta activity at the end of the record, at which point the record is terminated due to the need for a stat CAT scan of brain. On one occasion was a brief arousal. There was a 7 Hz posterior-dominant rhythm observed bilaterally.
	HR:	1 20 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.    Repetitive electrographic seizures in a confused patient, compatible with complex partial status.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This critical care pattern status epilepticus was communicated to the clinical team and plans were made for additional continuous EEG monitoring.
