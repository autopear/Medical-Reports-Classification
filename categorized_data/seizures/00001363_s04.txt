CLINICAL HISTORY:   58 year old woman with stroke and seizures, now with left-sided facial and body shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra, Dilantin.
	INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG  was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.	Â·
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is asymmetry of this record with faster activity and normal posterior  alpha rhythm seen at 8.5 on the left with slowing of the record on the right. On the right hemisphere in the T4, T6, and occipital region there are periodic sharp waves seen ranging from 50-60 mV in amplitude.  During the record facic,1l twitching is not seen on the video. Around 11:51 on the record progression of an
increase of activity is seen at T4 with a building up and quickening of the periodic
discharges that continues until 11:52. During this time no facial twitching is seen correlated with this episode on the record. This is again seen in the T4 location.
HR:   70 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Asymmetry with faster frequency seen on the left with slowing on the right.
	2.	Periodic sharp waves seen on the right in the mid temporal and occipital regions.
	3.	Subclinical seizure lasting 1 minute on the EEG, not correlated with video findings.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record is consistent with periodic sharp waves seen on the right that increase to a subclinical seizure lasting 1 minute on the record. This record is consistent with an epileptiform focus in the temporal occipital region on the right.
