CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old male with a history of brain tumor on the right with two resections, status-post radiation.  Patient presently has a left hemiparesis. He has been seizure-free for six years; total of 12 seizures described as focal left-sided jerking.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is awake, there is a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry. The left hemisphere is normal with alpha slow about 10 Hz. There are prominent sharp waves with a breach rhythm and delta and theta from right . 
There are seven subclinical seizures, most are maximum in the right mid to anterior temporal region but others are at T4/C4.  Some have alpha or theta frequency activity.  Others have repetitive spike and slow wave activity, mostly seen in the T2-T4 region.  
Photic stimulation is performed during one of his seizures and does not activate the record.  Seizures are seen in wakefulness and early drowsiness. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Seven focal seizures from the right temporal region without change in level of awareness with variability in terms of the type of epileptiform activity but with right centrotemporal localization. 
Focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for epilepsy, as well as a structural abnormality and a craniotomy.  These results were discussed with the referring physician.
