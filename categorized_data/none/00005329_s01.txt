CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old gentleman with no history of seizures in the past
comingin with shortness of breath worsening for one week and abdominal distention for one month. Patient had an episode of 5 minutes of unresponsiveness while hugging
the nurse on the bedside with mild confusion after the event. Patient's past medical historyis significant for CAD status post CABG,end stage liver disease.liver cirrhosis, hypertension,and  hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION : Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system electrode placement system with one anterior temporalelectrode and EKG electrode. Wakefulness and drowsiness was recorded. Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a slow background in theta frequency at 6-7 Hz with the amplitude of 10-15 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening. There was a small amount of frontocentral beta onboth sides. Drowsiness was characterized by the burst of theta at 5-6 Hz onboth hemispheres. Photic stimulation reveals no abnormaldischarges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Excessive bilateral theta onthe backgrounds.
Asynchronous delta frequencies at 1-2 Hz on both sides but more prominent in the right occipital than the left occipital.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive slowing on the background. .
Asynchronous delta frequency onthe right occipitalmore than theleft.
CLINICAL CORRELAT ION: This EEG showed excessive slowing in the background frequency at 1-2 Hz on the right occipitalmore than the left which,given the technical interpret. This EEG did not show any epileptiform discharges. Please note that no epileptiform discharges do not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Repeating the EEG in
thelab when possible is suggested.
