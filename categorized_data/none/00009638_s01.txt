CLINICAL HISTORY: 13-day-year-old infant born at 26 week gestation with perinatal  depression sepsis. Evaluate for seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: None 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using neonatal montage 
and 1 channel EKG. This is recorded at a paper speed of 10 seconds per page at 
traditional paper speech rather than slow paper speed. This is a 1 hour EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is a discontinuous pattern as is 
typically seen at 28 weeks gestation. There are portions of the record with lower voltage 
theta. There are also portions with high amplitude activity and there are some sharp 
waves in the right hemisphere. There are portions where the baby is motorically active 
and at those times, there is both cerebral activity and movement artifact. The cerebral 
activity may be synchronous or asynchronous. There is some theta activity in this 
record, but is it low voltage. 
HR: 150 bpm 
This EEG is likely, within the range of normal for an infant of this age. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record demonstrates discontinuity wit period as long 
as 20 seconds, but that may well be within the range of acceptability for an infant of this 
age. There are also some right hemispheric sharp waves again not outside of the range 
of normal for and infant of this age. The record is lower voltage than 1 might anticipate. 
No seizures were recorded. An infant with this extreme prematurity is permitted to have 
a discontinuous pattern as described above. If there are ongoing concerns, a repeat 
study as the infant matures may be considered.
