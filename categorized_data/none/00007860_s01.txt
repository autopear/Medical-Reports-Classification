CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 2.5-month-old female born at 36 weeks gestation with right-sided motor activity on admission 02/03/04.  Treated with Phenobarbital and Ativan and symptoms stopped after ten minutes.
MEDICATIONS: 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is awake and in the beginning of the record, she is having some cyclic movements of the right arm.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the child is awake.  There is eye movement and an appropriately rich background for an infant of this age.  She has some episodes with her right arm up in the air and circling.  At this time, the EEG is well organized, interpretable.  There is no epileptiform activity in association with this movement.  There are occasional sharp transience out of the left hemisphere, maximum in the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.  There are also rare transience from the right central regions.  At 9:57, the child has an episode where the left arm makes additional cycling-type movements.  No epileptiform features are identified with that behavior.  As the child becomes drowsy, there is an increase in amplitude of the background.  There is also an increase in delta.  
HR:  56 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits of normal for an infant of this gestational age because of the question of excessive sharp waves in the left frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Review of the video by the clinical team would be important to determine if the behaviors observed in the EEG are the behaviors in question.  No seizures with EEG correlates were identified.
