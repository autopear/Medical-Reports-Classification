CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 27-year-old woman with a childhood seizure disorder with recurrent seizures in recent months (last seizure one to two weeks ago with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion).  
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Of note, there is a single four second burst in photic stimulation where the patient seems to have had eye flutter, but looking at the eyes there is no discernable eye movement, and the activity is in the frontal regions with a somewhat different field of spread in the eye monitor in comparison to the patientâ€™s other eye movements.  This burst is highly suspicious for frontally predominant notched delta as might be seen in generalized spike and slow wave activity.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This EEG is abnormal due to:
	1.	A single, suspicious, approximately 2 to 3 second burst of notched frontal delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  The activity described above can be seen in a primary or secondary generalized process.  Rather than repeating additional studies, correlation with previous studies may be the most effective way to place these findings in their appropriate clinical context.
