MR: 26054601 
CLINICAL HISTORY: 14-day-old gestational age female with grade IV intraventricular 
hemorrhage. Seizures now improved grade to a new grade III. The child was born after the 
mother had expired. She has recently experienced 30 minutes of left arm seizure activity. 
MEDICATIONS: Caffeine, Phenobarbital, Chlorhexidine. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG and 1 channel of EEG. The child is observed to 
have some squirming activity. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE The background EEG is relatively low voltage for an infant 
of this age. It includes muscle activity, and intermittently discontinuous pattern of small amounts 
of bursts of theta and/or mixed alpha-theta frequency activity. The periods of suppression may 
be up to 4 seconds long. Positive sharp waves are observed from the left central temporal 
region. There are bursts of 10-11 Hertz activity which resemble the morphology of delta 
brushes, but are not actually fast activity. There are occasional bursts of high amplitude sharp 
waves from the right. On occasion, there are independent sharps from the right or left 
hemisphere. During this EEG, the child has some squirming movements with movement of the 
head. There are no behaviors that suggest sustained epileptiform activity. There are no 
electrical seizures. 
HR: 150 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an infant of this gestational age due to: 
1. Discontinuity. 
2. Excessive sharp waves from either hemisphere. 
3. At times, there are relatively lower voltage featureless pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. The discontinuity is greater than 
expected for gestational age. The sharp waves are somewhat increased for our acceptable 
range of normal. Low voltage pattern is a worrisome pattern at this gestational age.
