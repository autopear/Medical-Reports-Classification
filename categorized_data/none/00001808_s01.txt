CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 35-year-old male with confusion and disorientation while driving followed by a convulsion in the ER, intubated, agitated, requiring sedation.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan and Fentanyl infusions, Phenytoin, insulin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates replacement of the normal background with primarily a beta frequency pattern with smaller amounts of theta.   There are occasional bursts of very high amplitude frontally predominant 4 to 5 Hz activity, which are diffuse and are picked up in the eye leads but not the EKG.  There is no identifiable clinical correlate with these bursts.  Most are 4 to 5 Hz, but some are 2 to 3 Hz.  
There is variability in this record, particularly later portions of the record where there is an increase in background theta. Stimulation produces artifact, but does not clearly alter the record.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with primarily a beta frequency pattern albeit with smaller amounts of theta. 
Bursts of high amplitude delta, some of which is quite slow and occasionally similar wave forms of 4 to 5 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen.  No seizures were recorded.  The beta activity described above may be associated with this patientâ€™s medications.  The bursts of high amplitude delta are non-specific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, or deep gray nuclei.
