CLINICAL HISTORY: 74 year old woman with previous, massive, right MCA CVA presented with 2 seizures. The patient had a third seizure, received Ativan and became comatose. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode with-channel EKG. Seizure and spike detection is employed overnight for this individual
who suffered multiple seizures at 6 p.m. and became obtunded: Over the 
course of the recording, the patient gradually awakens. She voices complaints, although her speech is difficult to understand and increasingly moves her right arm.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: the course of this long-term recording, this 9 hour 
EEG starts out as a very slow, low-wage pattern, 
Markedly suppressed on the right side and intermittently discontinuous on the right. This 
pattern remains relatively static at 2 a.m. and at 4 a.m. No seizures are observed. There is intermittently this very gradual improvement in theta from the left. By 6: 11 a.m. the  
patient is clearly awakening with an increase in theta on the left. As she becomes increasingly 
awake, she is moving about producing muscle artifact, but low voltage theta is 
There is a suggestion of a phase reversal with some sharply contoured theta at T5-T3. At the 
close of recording, left posterior temporal delta is observed in a low voltage pattern with
relative suppression, but the burst suppression pattern has resolved. 
HR: 70 to 90 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to number 
1. Initially a  marked suppressed, even discontinuous pattern. 
2. Improvement over time, particularly from the left hemisphere with the appearance of theta activity on the left and some sharply contoured posterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports an improvement from what was initially a very severe postictal encephalopathy.
