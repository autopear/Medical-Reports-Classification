CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year-old woman with cardiac arrest on August 05, 2008. The 
patient began to have convulsions on August OG, 2008. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Pantoprazole, Simvastatin, ASA, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Novolin, 
Dopamine, Dobutamine 
Continuous digital video long term EEG was performed at bedside 
using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Frequent 
stimulation was done through the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background of the EEG was markedly slow 
and featureless. There was a mixed theta and delta activity all over the recording. 
There was no seizure evidence noted during the recording. Frequent patient 
examination was noted through all the recording. At one event, there was mild feature 
of arousal and reactivity noted but in many other events there were no significant 
background seemed to be slower, more discontinuous and occasional sharp waves 
were noted from the left temporal region with an amplitude of around 200 microvolts. 
This reversal was noted in T1-S7 mostly. No seizures were recorded in the last 24 
hours between August 7 and August 8. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Remarkably slow and featureless background. 
2. Left anterior temporal sharp activity. 
3. Absence of normal reactivity with stimulation. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG pattern supports the clinical finding of severe 
encephalopathy. The lack of free activity suggests poor prognosis and severe 
disturbance in the normal brain function.
