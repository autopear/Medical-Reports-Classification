CLINICAL HISTORY: 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenytoin, Keppra, DILANTIN. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed. No clinical patient information is provided at this time. There 
are no push buttons to indicate the presence or absence of seizures. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 
19 year old male with Noonan syndrome and recurrent seizures. 
The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with 
diffuse beta. There is Intermittent rhythmic theta in the right central temporal region. As 
the patient becomes more active, however, with better quality EEG, there is really more 
of a rhythmic theta pattern and a posterior dominant rhythm in the theta frequency 
range with a suggestion of some slowing in the' right posterior quadrant. In the overnight 
recording, there are some paroxysmal bursts of beta or alpha frequency activity. There 
are problems with intermittent lack. of electrode integrity. 
HR: 96bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with primarily a beta frequency pattern. 
Some focal slowing and rhythmic slowing in the right hemisphere which is 
complicated by poor electrode integrity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Arousals are observed in the record, compatible with 
changes in the patient's sedative hypnotic medications. No electrographic seizures can 
be identified in the file although given the quality of the recording because of the 
electrode problems, events may have been overlooked.
