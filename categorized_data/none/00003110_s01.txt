CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old male who presents with left temporal stroke.  Past medical history significant for IV drug abuse and hepatitis C.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Versed, Percocet, antibiotics, cortical steroids, Risperdal, methadone, Phenobarbital, Topiramate, Acyclovir, and others.   
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and sedated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage with increased diffuse beta.  From the beginning, there is nearly continuous left temporal PLEDS at .5 to 1 Hz, 100 V.  This is accompanied by focal slowing and seems to be originating from the F7 area.  No clinical seizures were seen on the digital video camera.  Stimulation of the patient did not cause reactivity or variability.  
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Nearly continuous left temporal PLEDS with focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates left temporal PLEDS, which are consistent with a structural lesion secondary to a stroke in that area.  The continuous PLEDS without clinical seizures is suggestive of _________ status of non-convulsive seizures.  The result of this record was communicated to the primary neurology team.
