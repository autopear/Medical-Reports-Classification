	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	57 year old male with massive right thalamic intracerebral hemorrhage with increased ICP, ventriculostomy,  decerebrate posturing, and spontaneous eye movements. Three days status post intracerebral hemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS:   Lopressor, Labetalol, Tylenol, Insulin
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Electrode placement I modified due to the ventriculostomy. The patient is comatose but is examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is markedly abnormal, slow, disorganized with a slow delta pattern, eye movements,  and occasional theta. Stimulation of the patient produces an attenuation of the background or slowing of the background.   Occasional Cheyne-Stokes  respiration is observed without a clear change in the EEG.
HR:   100 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Replacement  of normal background with a slow relatively featureless delta pattern, disconjugate eye movement artifacts, and occasional theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded, and no epileptiform features were noted.
