CLINICAL HISTORY:   60-year-old male who was found to have a left intracerebral hemorrhage. Status: Previous stroke, hypertension and an AVM. Now comatose without gag or corneal responses.
MEDICATIONS:   Keppra, Mannitol, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall background  is a theta-delta pattern. The activity from the left temporal region is lower voltage. It is slightly higher voltage and more irregular from the right. Sharp waves are observed in the right hemisphere  with variable amplitude maxima and field. There is a high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow-wave complex followed by background suppression. In addition there is lower voltage right posterior temporal
sharp waves and a single one F7. Stimulation of the patient failed to activate the record.
	HR: 	102  bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Background slowing.
	2. 	Arrhythmic delta activity with a relatively lower voltage pattern on the left.
	3. 	Sharp waves from the right with variable field and variable maxima including right interior temporal and right posterior.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Comparison with previous studies may be important. No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance  of cerebral function. The absence of reactivity and variability are concerning but there is a continuous EEG pattern observed.
