CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old male with dementia, right subdural hematoma, declining mental status, renal failure. 
MEDICATIONS: Atropine, Clonidine, Acetaminophen, Lisinopril, Norvasc, Zocor, Hydralazine, Codine, Phoslo, Renagel, Dilantin, Metoprolol, Protonix, Insulin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a continuous pattern. The activity is relatively high in amplitude. On occasion there is a defined 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. A breech rhythm is identified with higher amplitude activity in the right frontal region. 
Occasional triphasic waves are observed. There is also some sharply contoured delta in the right mid to anterior temporal region. There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left. In addition, the triphasic waves are higher amplitude on the right in comparison to the left. Oral automatisms are not associated with the change in the background EEG. This EEG demonstrates some fluctuations with some sections demonstrating more significant rhythmic alpha and theta frequency activity. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing and disorganization which is at times quite prominent. 
2. Irregular bilateral delta. 
3. FIRDA occasionally seen in trains. 
4. Rare right mid to anterior sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most compatible with an underlying encephalopathy which may be toxic or metabolic in nature. The triphasic waves are hallmarks of a metabolic encephalopathy and the amplitude asymmetry may be accentuated by the breech rhythm. Chewing movements were not associated with epileptiform activity. The most striking features about this EEG are the triphasic waves and the bursts of background slowing compatible with metabolic encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded.
