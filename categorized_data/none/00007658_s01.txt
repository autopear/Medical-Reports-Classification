CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year-old woman with epilepsy characterized  by tonic clonic seizures out of sleep, with incontinence and tongue biting. Past history of depression and multiple suicide attempts.
MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, BuSpar, Celexa, Famotidine, Dilantin, Temazepam. INTRODUCTION: One hour digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10/20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal, central beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing a small degree of background  slowing. As the patient becomes drowsy, focal slowing is identified from the left temporal region with occasional sharp waves. Other features of drowsiness include POSTS. As the patient reaches stage 1 sleep, a
rhythmic delta maximum at T1 with T1 sharp and slow wave complexes is observed.
Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and POSTS are observed in sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
	HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Left anterior temporal focal slowing.
	2. 		Left anterior temporal high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes observed in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are identical to a previous one hour study, June 27, 2007. No seizures were recorded.
