CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 59-year-old male with a left basal ganglia CVA/bleed and acute coma.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and sedated.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, but demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The activity from the left hemisphere, particularly the frontocentral regions and the frontotemporal regions, is low voltage and relatively suppressed.  In the right hemisphere, there is medium amplitude theta frequency activity and there are intermittent bursts of generalized, bihemispheric frontally predominant delta.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an increase in theta frequency activity from the right hemisphere and a suggestion of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized an by increase in low voltage, frontocentral beta activity on the right.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity from the left and decreased amplitude.
Slowing from the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left affecting both gray and white matter.  No seizures or epileptiform features were recorded.
