CLINICAL HISTORY:   40 year  old woman status post left frontal oligodendroglioma, or anaplastic neoplasm, with hydrocephalus,  recent hospitalization at Potts Town for recurrent seizures, now with persistent language difficulty and change in mental status, but no well defined seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal, diffusely slow, poorly organized with continuous arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere, particularly frontocentral, frontotemporal regions.  A breech rhythm is observed.  There are portions in the record with a 9 Hz posterior dominate rhythm.  Features of drowsiness included increase in rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz activity.   As the patient becomes drowsy, in the context of a breech rhythm, sharp waves are observed at F3 and T1.
	HR: 	84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
	2. 	Superimposed nearly continuous arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere, congruent with the prior craniotomy.
	3. 	Occasional sharp waves, left frontal and temporal
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is more supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a structural process on the left.  No seizures were recorded. The epileptiform activity was relatively modest.
