MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, propofol versed Zofran. 
HISTORY: 
A 63-year-old male, status post assault with left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage, abnormal EEG, which responded to the use of Valium 
INTRODUCTION: 
24 hour Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. There is very limited video reviewed. In addition, due to the patient's acuity and multiple medical 
devices, the patient is essentially hidden under all of the equipment.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
Background EEG IS markedly abnormal It includes a pattern of slowing With prominent beta and delta. They are sharply contoured waveforms noted in the background Including right occipital and bilateral frontal. There is 
some waxing and waning 1n terms of the faster frequency activity. There are rare portions including overnight recording where muscles, artifact, and eye movements noted. 
Heart rate 120 BPM 
IMPRESSION: 
Long-term Video EEG monitoring session is remarkable for, 
1. Remarkably slow background 
2. Sharp waves noted in the record at t1mes somewhat prominent 
3. The absence of subclinical seizures. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. It IS overall an irritative pattern with sharp activity in the night hemisphere including central and occipital. At the close of the record, there was an improvement with some faster frequency activity on the night, and a decrease in epileptiform activity No seizures were recorded.
