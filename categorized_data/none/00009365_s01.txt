CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman of unknown handedness is evaluated for left-sided weakness and unresponsiveness with glucose less than 4, chronic subdural hematoma and large right MCA/CV A. 
MEDICATIONS: Loratadine, Vanco, Cyclobenzaprine, Amlodipine, Heparin, 
Reisperdone, Zocor, Pantoprazole, Aosyn, Insulin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is unresponsive, intubated with eyes open but has occasional spontaneous movements. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite significant muscle artifact, the background EEG is abnormal and includes a pattern of theta, frontally predominant delta and an interhemispheric asymmetry. There is more muscle on the left. On the right, there is sharply contoured periodic complexes in the right posterior quadrant. There is variability in the record and as the technologist interacts with the patient, the patient is responsive with some alpha and theta frequency activity. 
HR: 130 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. A pattern of background slowing present in both hemispheres. 
2. Superimposed asymmetry with lower voltage, slower pattern on the right. 
3. Occasional periodic complexes in the right hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG demonstrates a reactive pattern with an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity with stimulation. No seizures were recorded. The broadly contoured periodic complexes support a potential for seizures.
