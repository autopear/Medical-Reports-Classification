CLINICAL HISTORY: This  is  a  44-year-old   male  with  alcohol  withdrawal,  head trauma, and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Probably Trazodone, Lexapro, or others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video BEG is perfom1ed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system  of  electrode  placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG.  The  patient  is  somewhat confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background BEG is abnom1al and includes a pattern of diffuse  beta.   The left hemisphere  demonstrates  higher amplitude  arrhythmic delta  activity  with  a breach  rhythm  and  at  times  sharply contoured  delta  in the  left frontocentral frontotemporal region.   Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta, but deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
HR:  96BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal BEG due to:
1.  Excess background  beta.
2.   Continuous  mixed  arrhythmic  delta and theta from the left hemisphere,  particularly from the frontocentral region.
3.   Sharply contoured delta in the same region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This BEG supports a structural abnormality  on the left, as well as likely  a p1ior breach rhythm given the head trauma histo1y.  Excess beta may be due to medications  or other causes.  No seizures were recorded.
