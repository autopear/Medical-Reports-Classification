CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old male with refractory seizures. 

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is increasingly awake and alert during this section of the record. He remains confused. The clinical team reports no 
seizures at this time. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to demonstrate a slightly slow pattern from the right but arrhythmic delta activity from the left with sharply contoured slowing. Features of sleep include vertex waves. As the recording continues there are increasing sections of the record while the patient is awake and toward the early morning hours on 7/2/2010, he is starting to take off his EEG electrodes. 

The EEG concludes on the afternoon of the second. There remain sections of the record with  periodic frontal sharp waves particularly FT1 or F3. There is also some sharply contoured delta in the right temporal region. Focal slowing is characterized by intermittent attenuation of faster frequency activity In the left hemisphere particularly the left parasagittal region. 

HR: 96 bpm 

IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring is remarkable for: 
1. Prominent epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere including left frontotemporal and left frontocentral region. 
2. Focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency on the left. 
3. A mild background slowing on the right. 

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No clinical seizures were recorded but this remains a very epileptogenic pattern.
