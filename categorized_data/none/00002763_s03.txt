.,   .
DESCRIPTION OF THE R ECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well defined alpha rhythm with generous beta activity, vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and abundant posts are noted on stage II sleep. Lambda is noted in wakefulness.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 60 to 80 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This 48 hour long term monitoring study is remarkable for:
	1. 	No epileptiform activity.
	2. 	No clearly defined clinical events.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports failed to identify epileptiform activity today.
