HISTORY:  19 yr old female with shaking activity during sleep.
MEDICATION: Heparin, Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous Video EEG was performed in the unit.   There are a number of patient push buttons.  There is no technical log regarding these events.    No history and no information from the nurses regarding this patient's care.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although there are some problems with electrode integrity, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant.   Drowsiness is characterized by excess background theta.  This is a sharply contoured record with a fair amount of chew artifact but  in  the  initially  portions  of  the  record,  drowsiness  is  characterized  by  rhythmic background theta.  Vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles are seen.
PUSH BUTTON EVENTS:
12/02105, 14:24- No epileptiform features were seen.
12/03/05, 09:03 - The patient is arguing with someone on the phone.  Although, there is muscle and motion artifact when she gets agitated, the EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern. No testing is performed.
Long-Term Monitoring, 12103105-12104105
DESCRIPTION   OF  THE  RECORD:     In  wakefulness, the  background EEG  is remarkable for some quality issues but there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.
EVENTS:
11:57 am- The patient is asleep in stage II sleep and there are no epileptiform features seen.
19:23 (practice push  button) - No epileptiform features are identified in this section of
the record.
HR:  80BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This 48 hour EEG is remarkable for:
1.     Absence of reported seizures or identifiable seizures
2.   One push button event occurring in wakefulness without evidence of seizure
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   Additional information would be helpful to determine whether or not what this patient's clinical concerns were.  No seizures were recorded and no epileptiform features were seen.
