CLINICAL IDSTORY: This is a 53-year-old woman with a history of a blood clot as a child 
with subsequent development of epilepsy. Seizure-free since 2003. 
MEDICATIONS: Neurontin, Tegretol, Pravachol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were 
performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. This is a half hour EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm 
identified from the right, at times 10.5 Hz. The right hemisphere is reasonably well organized, 
but the left hemisphere demonstrates continuous arrhythmic delta activity, which is sharply 
contoured. There is an underlying breach rhythm with accentuation of the amplitude of activity 
in that region and some double phase reversal, perhaps due to the shape of the cranium. Sharply 
contoured delta is noted from the left hemisphere with variable maximum including T3, TS, and 
Tl. There are occasional bursts of rhythmic. slowing from the right. Hyperventilation may 
accentuate the background slowing. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR.: 78BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere, maximum in the temporal region. 
2. Sharply contoured delta and a handful of sharp waves from the left including T3, T5 or T1 
sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The previous craniotomy may accentuate underlying 
epileptiform activity. No seizures were recorded. The previous 2003 EEG was inconclusive due 
to artifact, but this clearly demonstrates focal slowing.
