CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old with intracerebral hemorrhage. 
MEDICATIONS: Lorazepam, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Tylenol, Beclofen 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and 
includes at times a chaotic, disorganized pattern with shifting arrhythmic delta activity. 
There is significant EKG artifact. There is more arrhythmic delta activity in the right 
hemisphere in comparison to the left. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in 
theta. In addition, there is occasional FIRDA. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly disorganized background. 
2. Arrhythmic delta activity is both hemispheres. 
3. An area of focal arrhythmic delta activity in the right. 
CLINICAL This EEG is most supportive of a diffuse disturbance of 
cerebral function. No seizures were recorded.
