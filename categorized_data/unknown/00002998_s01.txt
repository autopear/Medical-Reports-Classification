CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 33-year-old woman status-post resection of right cerebellar mass and status-post placement of right VP shunt with development of secondary right basal ganglionic hemorrhage.  Patient found to have left arm twitching.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Neurontin, insulin, codeine, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent and mildly lethargic.  Stimulation of the patient was not performed.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is fairly well organized with mild excessive theta of 5 to 7 Hz.  In maximum wakefulness, there is an occasional alpha rhythm identified of 9.5 Hz. Occasionally, posterior delta is seen from the right occipital region. FIRDA is seen after the patient drifts off to sleep.  Stage I sleep is achieved with occasional vertex waves, but no spindles or K complexes were seen to indicate stage II sleep or deeper sleep stages.  Occasionally, a right-hand high frequency tremor and twitching of the left fifth digit are seen, which do not show any electrophysiologic correlate. 
HR:  102 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
Isolated high amplitude delta from the right occipital regions occurring at a frequency of 3 to 4 Hz.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform discharges were seen.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat tracing in order to capture deeper stages of sleep would be appropriate.
