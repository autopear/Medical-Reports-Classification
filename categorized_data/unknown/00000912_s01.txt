CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 33-year-old male with AVM treated with gamma knife procedure on chronic Dilantin, but with poor compliance and difficulty maintaining therapeutic Dilantin level.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 800 mg per day.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. Unfortunately, there is a fair amount of artifact identified in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In this somewhat challenging EEG, there is subtle focal slowing with some rhythmic frontocentral theta and disruption of faster frequency activity in the left frontocentral region.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and slowing of the background.  Hyperventilation produced bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude slowing.  Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Subtle focal slowing from the left frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Correlation with imaging may be helpful regarding the focal features described above.
