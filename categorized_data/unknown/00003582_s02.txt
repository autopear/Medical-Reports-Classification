CLINICAL HISTORY:   58 year-old right handed gentleman with epilepsy. The patient attributes his epilepsy to his alcohol abuse, but also has a family history of epilepsy. Typically, as a seizure per year, but now is having increasing shakiness, memory loss and both urinary urgency, nocturia and incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Lisinopril, Simvastatin,  Aspir, Sertraline
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. The overall awake background is slightly disorganized with a small amount of background  theta. Vertex waves, spindles and K complexes are observed in stage 2 sleep as is snore artifact. Hyperventilation  produces a small amount of background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits no significant driving.
	HR: 	72 bpm
IMPR ESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Mild background disorganization in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed today. Given the patient's history of alcohol and some of the symptoms that he is reporting at this time, additional clinical evaluation may be important particularly with the shakiness, alcohol history and Depakote.
