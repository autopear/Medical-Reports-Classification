CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 21-month-old female with tactile fever on Saturday along with cough, rhinorrhea, and increased intake.  On January 27, the baby was taken to a babysitter who noted the infant to be lethargic with seizures. When the baby was brought to the ER, she had drop seizures. Ativan 2 mg was administered, and Dilantin was initiated in the ER
MEDICATIONS: Ibuprofen and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard pediatric electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric, continuous, and normal for a child of this age.  The majority of the EEG is recorded while the patient is asleep.  When the child is aroused, a predominant 6 to 7 Hz is seen in the central and posterior areas.  Sleeping is evidenced by vertex waves, spindles. There is hypersynchronous delta activity suggestive of stage III sleep.  Occasionally, IV drip or EEG cable artifact is also seen.  
HR:  126 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal awake and asleep EEG record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
