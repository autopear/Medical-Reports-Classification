CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an unknown male found by fire rescue having a tonic-clonic seizure with bilateral twitching.  The patient was subsequently profoundly unresponsive and was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis.  Previous right VKA. Abnormal CT.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and insulin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is now responsive to stimuli and agitated whenever he is stimulated.  The patient is intubated and in a hard collar. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern albeit one that is quite slow with slow delta and smaller amounts of theta and beta.  The theta and beta activity is more prominent in the frontal regions.  There is clear variability in the record with some portions of the record demonstrating more of the theta than others.   
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Replacement of normal background with prominent, slow delta and a smaller amount of faster frequency activity in the frontal regions.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific, but can be seen in a severe, underlying metabolic abnormality, as was the case with this individual with a glucose reading of 1000.  No epileptiform features were seen, and there were no subclinical seizures.
