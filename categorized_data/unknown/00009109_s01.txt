CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 83-year-old, right-handed male with a history of epilepsy, seizure-free off medications three years ago, but with acute seizures yesterday and while in church with a midline small hemorrhage and a right cerebral contusion.  
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Dilantin, Nexium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation could be performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake, but intermittently during the record he becomes agitated  There are brief portions of the record with an 8.5 Hz  posterior dominant rhythm.  When he is maximally awake, there is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity in the right posterior quadrant, as well as some delta from the right posterior quadrant.  Wicket activity is better defined on the left in comparison to the right.  In the waking record, there is wicket, but no clear epileptiform activity. The patient becomes agitated before he becomes drowsy.  Features of drowsiness include slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.  In addition, the intrahemispheric asymmetry is accentuated and the patient then has spontaneous arousals and is agitated.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Technically challenging EEG due to the patient’s agitation and motion artifact, but abnormal due to:
	Arrhythmic delta from the right hemisphere.
	Mild background slowing for age.
	Suspicious left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The arrhythmic delta on the right correlates with the patient’s cerebral contusion.  Given the presence of wicket activity and the quality of the awake recording, additional studies may be helpful to make sure that there is not an epileptiform focus on the left.
