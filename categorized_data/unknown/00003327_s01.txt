CLINICAL HISTORY: 50-year-old male with a history of epilepsy and left parietal craniotomy who was found seizing.  Seizure described as head and eye deviation to the left with subsequent right-sided weakness.  CT scan revealed an old left parietal encephalomalacia.  Patient is also a crack cocaine smoker.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and antibiotics. Ativan given by ER staff. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is unresponsive.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage in a patient with a large craniotomy on the left.  There are occasional sharp waves seen at C3 to T3 and P3, C3.  There is occasionally sharply contoured delta over the left mid-temporal area.  The sharp waves seen over C3 and P3 are more pronounced during increased drowsiness.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional sharp waves over C3, T3, and P3, C3.
Left mid-temporal sharply contoured delta and a breach rhythm on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient. The background slowing is non-specific but is consistent with the patientâ€™s postictal state.
