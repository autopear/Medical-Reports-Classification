CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 31-year-old male admitted with a left cerebellar stroke and right hemiparesis.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, morphine, Ativan, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed due to the patientâ€™s medical condition. This record was done after the patient was extubated, wearing a facemask.  This is a drowsy or possibly sedated record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG showed an extremely low voltage but symmetric 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm which is reactive.   During drowsiness left occipital 5 Hz, 15 V activity, which was not seen in the right hemisphere.  The patient appears to be excessively drowsy.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing at the left occipital area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The low voltage pattern of EEG in this patient is a nonspecific finding and can be a normal variant.  Focal theta at the left posterior region may be suggestive of a structural lesion.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG after the patient is stabilized and out of the ICU would be useful.
