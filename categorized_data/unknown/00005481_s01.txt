CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year-old male found on an unknown date with seizures. Last 
seen 1 day prior to April 28. Intubated and loaded with phenytoin. CT scan identifies 
bilateral frontal hypodensities with vasogenic edema. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Narcan, Etomidate, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates an abnormal 
pattern which is slow. There is a pattern of theta with delta. In addition, there is 
superimposed, sharply contoured slowing in the right frontal region. The EEG is 
intermittently somewhat discontinuous. Bifrontal, triphasic appearing sharp waves are 
also observed. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta and a decrease 
in discontinuity. 
HR: 144 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a markedly slow pattern. 
2. Intermittent discontinuous pattern. 
3. Bifrontal, and right frontal sharp waves with superimposed sharp wave contoured 
slowing on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral 
function. The frontal findings are congruent with the description of the CT abnormality. A 
right frontal focus for seizures could be considered.
