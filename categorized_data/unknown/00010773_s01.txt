CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year-old with a single seizure associated with tongue biting, 
incontinence and prolonged postictal aphasia. The patient is left handed and during the 
EEG he is able to speak. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Zocor, Folate Acid 
Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is examined during the 
EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite of great deal of muscle and movement 
artifact, the background EEG does demonstrate some background slowing and shifting 
asymmetry. The right hemisphere demonstrates a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 to 8 
hertz. The left hemisphere demonstrated disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm 
and a bit more arrhythmic mixed theta and delta on the left in comparison to the right. 
HR: 90 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Superimposed focal slowing on the left with disruption of faster frequency of 
activity. 
CLINICAL This EEG supports both a diffuse disturbance of cerebral 
function as well as a functional or structural process on the left. Additional recording 
capturing sleep may be helpful to capture epileptiform activity.
