CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year-old gentleman admitted earlier this week with DKA, 
glucose of 600 and status epilepticus. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is relatively somnolent 
but is not intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates diffusely slow 
pattern with a significant amount of muscle and chew artifact. When he is not 
stimulated, the EEG is occasionally somewhat discontinuous. In the challenging record, 
there are occasional left inferotemporal sharp waves. When he is awake and moving 
about, the record includes a theta frequency pattern. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to 
1. Marked background slowing with fluctuations from a modestly slow pattern awake 
to almost a discontinuous pattern in sleep. 
2. Occasional left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The pattern of sleep seems more compatible with a 
chronic encephalopathy, particularly in that he has a discontinuous pattern but is not 
comatose, just drowsy.
