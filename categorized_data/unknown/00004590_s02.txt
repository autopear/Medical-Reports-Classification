CLINICAL HISTORY:  45-year-old male with leg weakness, epilepsy, sarcoid, vena cava syndrome , renal failure , multiple strokes. Left leg weakness causing falls, but no current seizures.MEDICATIONS: DilantinINTRODUCTION :  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no photic stimulation nor hyperventilation.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage , frontocentral beta activity. Occasional arrhythmic delta activity is observed more so in the right hemisphere than the left . Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing, followed by spontaneous arousals.HR:	90 bpmIMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:1. Intermittent arrhythmic delta activity observed from the right hemisphere .2. Occasional shifting arrhythmic delta activity in a transition from sleep in either hemisphere.CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were observed. This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right. There is trivial, shifting arrhythmic delta activity, but a bit more prominent than one would anticipate for a subject of this age. Correlation with imaging and clinical history may be beneficial.
