CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old woman found down at home _________ with vomiting.  History significant for alcohol abuse, seizure disorder, and depression. 
MEDICATIONS: Versed, Dilantin, antibiotics, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized with superimposed excessively slow activity of theta and delta.  There is also a great deal of muscle movement artifact.  After the filter and sensitivity is adjusted, the excessive delta activity is also seen diffusely on the background.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not identified.  After adjusting the sensitivity, the background appears to be somewhat asymmetric with attenuation on the right hemisphere.  Stimulation of the patient temporarily increases the slow waves, as well as increasing the amplitude on the background.   
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Disorganized background.
	Background slowing with mild asymmetry with attenuation in the right hemisphere.
	Absent alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is indicative of a cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter, as well as the central nuclei in the midline.  The asymmetric EEG pattern may be suggestive of a structural abnormality.  Correlation with neuroimaging studies may be helpful.  However, the pattern is non-specific as to the etiology and can be seen in patients with encephalopathy secondary to metabolic, infectious, structural lesions, or postictal phase.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
