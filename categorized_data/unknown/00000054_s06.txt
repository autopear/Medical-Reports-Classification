CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old male with a history of a left MCA CVA admitted with status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarb and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and uncomfortable.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, diffusely slow with a mixture of low voltage, slow delta and superimposed beta.  There is a beta asymmetry with richer beta frequency activity from the right compared to the left. In addition, the delta activity is a little higher amplitude on the right compared to the left, and the left appears to be more featureless than the right.  
Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  
HR:  45 to 50 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a very slow pattern of delta with superimposed beta. 
2. Intrahemispheric asymmetry with more beta and delta identified from the right suggesting that the pathology involves the left hemisphere more than the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  please pull priors?!
