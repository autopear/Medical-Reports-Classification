CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year-old with 2 seizures in the emergency room. Past history 
of epilepsy, diabetes, hypertension prostate cancer. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy 
record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is permanently a theta 
frequency background with rhythmic data and some bursts of shifting delta. There is 
occasional FIRDA particularly as the patient become drowsy. Prominent shifting 
asymmetries are observed. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slow and disorganized background record. 
2. Shifting slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The background 
slowing and disorganization may be correlated with imaging. If epilepsy is an important 
consideration, a more prolonged study capturing the deeper stages of sleep is advised.
