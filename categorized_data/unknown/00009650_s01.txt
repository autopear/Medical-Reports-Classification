CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old gentleman with an old right MCA infarct with a subacute right MCA subdural with a seizure followed by unresponsiveness, subsequent development of massive left ICA infarct, as well as thrombosis in the left arm. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The activity from the left hemisphere is low voltage with some low voltage, theta frequency activity from the left hemisphere. From the right hemisphere, there is a mixture of theta ranging from 4 to 7 Hz with some arrhythmic delta activity.  Sharp waves are identified which are maximum at T4 but with a generous field of spread into the central and parietal regions.  Stimulation of the patient produces a small amount of theta frequency activity from both hemispheres. 
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing from both hemispheres with prominent slowing from the left hemisphere, although there is some residual theta activity in the frontal regions.
Focal slowing with sharp waves from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a processes affecting both hemispheres in unique ways.  These results are congruent with this patientâ€™s CT scan which was reviewed by the clinical team.
