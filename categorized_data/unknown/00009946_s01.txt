CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old male, status post head trauma, subarachnoid 
hemorrhage and seizure disorder now with recent grand mal seizure. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness, an intrahemispheric 
asymmetry is seen with slower frequencies in the right hemisphere. There is a disrupted 
posterior dominant alpha rhythm on that side with a disruption of faster frequency seen. 
On the left hemisphere, a posterior dominant alpha rhythm of 9 hertz is seen at 25 
microvolts. As the record comes to an end, the technician notes that the patient is 
intermittently confused. At this point, some periods of slowing bilaterally of the 
background is seen. There is also bilateral theta activity. During photic stimulation, there 
is a bit of driving seen in the left hemisphere. Photoelectric artifact is seen as well. 
HR: 126 bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slower frequency activity in the right hemisphere. 
2. A period of bilateral slowing during confusion. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity or seizures recorded on 
this record. The slowing in the right hemisphere is consistent with structural lesion of the 
right hemisphere. The intermittent confusion described to the patient during this bilateral 
slowing is compatible with delirium. If of further concern for the diagnosis of epilepsy, 
can repeat this study.
