	CLINICAL HISTORY:	83-year-old with arachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, vent-dependent respiratory failure, renal failure, anemia, epilepsy or seizures, candid UTI. Evaluate for seizures. The patient is extremely hard of hearing and sometimes appears to be unresponsive when she does not hear.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra,  Heparin,  Benadryl, Viokase Tab, ASA, Insulin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG in wakefulness includes a somewhat slow and disorganized pattern, but there is a posterior dominant rhythm averaging 6 to 7 Hz. Shifting arrhythmic delta is observed. At  times, there are some shifting asymmetries in terms of disruption of faster frequency activity in either hemisphere.
	HR: 	96 bpm, irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Background slowing.
	2.	Shifting slowing.
	3.	Shifting arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were observed in this record. Previous studies will  be requested to compare this study to past studies.
