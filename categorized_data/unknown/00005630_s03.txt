CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old male with epilepsy, renal failure, hypertension and 
HIV. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Pantoprazole, Zocor 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, but 
awake and responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a challenging EEG with a great deal of both 
1.5 Hz delta activity and 6 Hz theta. In the sections of the record when the patient is 
moving about there is a bit more theta. Frontally predominant delta is noted. This is a 
technically challenging EEG, but there seems to be a bit of asymmetry with a bit more 
theta on the left, however, there is a great deal of muscle artifact. There is a suggestion 
of a triphasic wave or 2 in the background. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a mixture of rhythmic 4-6 theta 
frequency activity and 1-2 Hz delta activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral 
function. There clearly is an awake and a sleep pattern in this individual. The awake 
section of the record is remarkable for a fair amount of artifact and consequently more 
subtle findings which may include focal features, sharp waves, or triphasic waves may 
be under represented.
