CLINICAL HISTORY:   68-year-old,  right handed woman with a history of epilepsy, seizure-free for the last 5 years with low dose Dilantin, admitted with nystagmus and found to have a PICA stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Dilanitn
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy there is an increase in theta. In addition, shifting arrhythmic delta activity, some of which is sharply contoured on the left with a subtle underlying sharp wave is observed. As the patient becomes drowsier, shifting arrhythmic delta can be seen from either temporal region. Some of this focal slowing on the right is posterior temporal. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
	HR: 	60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Shifting arrhythmic delta from the right or left hemisphere.
	2. 	Some sharply contoured slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The focal slowing described above is nonspecific in an adult of this age. Correlation with imaging and a history of cerebrovascular disease may be helpful as this kind of slowing is commonly seen in that age group. There is some sharply contoured slowly and some subtle sharp waves on the left in this individual with a past history of epilepsy.
