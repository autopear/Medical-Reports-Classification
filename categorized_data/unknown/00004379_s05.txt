CLT   ICAL  HISTORY: TI1is is a 51-year-old  male with epilepsy  and alcohol abuse who presents after a generalized  breakthrough seizure.  The patient is non-compliant with his medica tions.   Prior stroke with residual left-sided weakness.
MEDICATJO 1S: Dilantin, Topamax, and Lib1ium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed  at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of elecn·ode placement  with one cham1el of EKG. Photic stimulation was perfonned.  This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  REC ORD:  As  the  tracing  opens,  the   background  EEG  is  mildly disorganized and slo'vv with excessive amounts of theta.  There is a fair amount of frontocentral beta activity.  Occasional left temporal spike and slow waves are seen, as well as occasional right temporal and frontocent ral sharp waves that sometimes appear as brief trains. Spike and wave complexes occur independently  fi.·om  either  side.    There  is  occasional  mil d  focal  left  temporal  slowing.    Photic stimulation elici ts a discrete d1iving response. Stages of sleep are not achieved.
HR: 84BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnom1al EEG due to:
1.   Independent temporal sharp waves, which are more frequent on the 1ight than the left hemisphere.
2.   Mild generalized and disorganized background.
3.   Occasional slowing from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This traci11g suppons a patiialmecha nism for this patient 's epilepsy. In compa1ison  to  previous  EEGs,  this  was  the  second  record  out  of  eight  that  showed  focal epileptifoml discharges.  The amount of discharges is increased compared to the record from Ja nuary
2004.   At tlus point, it is not clear whetl1er this EEG picture sign ifies a progression  of the patien t's seizu re disorder or if it is an interictal phenomenon.   Correlation with neuroimaging  studies may be helpful.
