CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 29-year-old, postpartum woman with new onset epilepsy after delivering a child in September 2001.  Last seizure six months ago.  Seizures are characterized by loss of consciousness with postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes 9.5 Hz, 35 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta.  There is some hypersynchronous, rhythmic theta in the transition to drowsiness.  Rare vertex waves were identified.  
Hyperventilation produces a small degree of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving at intermediate and faster flash frequencies.  
HR:  54 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG with sinus bradycardia.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, either a repeat tracing or comparison with this patientâ€™s previous studies may be useful.
