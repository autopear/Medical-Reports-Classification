CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old, obese female with diabetes, hypertension, and renal insufficiency who presents with change in mental status.  She had a seizure in the emergency room and was given Ativan and Dilantin. CAT scan of the brain was negative.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, insulin, and antihypertensives.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient was drowsy through most of the record, in drowsiness the EEG is low voltage, diffusely slow, with quite a bit of beta activity with theta intermixed activity. Brief arousals were characterized by an increase in amplitude with some alpha frequency activity.  Occasionally, arrhythmic delta activity was identified diffusely Vertex wave and spindles were also identified in stage II sleep. 
HR:  56 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Low voltage recording with generous amounts of beta activity.
Diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG pattern is non-specific, but is suggestive of a diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The beta activity may be due to medication such as Ativan use.  No focal nor epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a follow-up EEG in the future is recommended.
