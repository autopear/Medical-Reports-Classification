CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old male with intracerebral hemorrhage; after a fall, had a seizure at the outside hospital and was found to have a right parenchymal and extra-axial hemorrhage. Past history of seizures at age 13, deafness, and perinatal spinal meningitis. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Famotidine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is not intubated and is arousable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow and poorly organized pattern although it is relatively rich in theta and some alpha frequency activity. The major abnormalities in this record are high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave complexes, some of which occur in bursts and trains and some of which have clear frequency evolution. There is clear variability in the record with transitions from more of an alpha-theta frequency pattern to a slower pattern. There is also an amplitude asymmetry. The activity from the left hemisphere is higher amplitude than the right. 
HR: 100 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. High amplitude left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave and spike and slow wave complexes occurring in bursts and trains. 
2. Left anterior temporal arrhythmic and rhythmic delta. 
3. Generalized background slowing. 
4. An asymmetry with lower voltage activity on the right compared to the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the history suggested a right-sided cerebral injury, there is prominent epileptiform activity from the left. Consideration for additional EEG recording, or at least a follow-up study in 24 hours, is suggested.
