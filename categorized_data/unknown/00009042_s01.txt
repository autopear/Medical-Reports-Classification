H  ISTORY: 42 yr old male with new onset seizures 3 weeks ago in the context of alcohol withdrawal. History of throat cancer, diagnosed 07/2005.
MEDICATION: Dilantin. ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz, 50uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movement and attenuation of the alpha. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:   96 BPM
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage I sleep.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified in this record.   Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.   If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep would be helpful.
