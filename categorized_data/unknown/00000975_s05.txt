CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old woman status post subarachnoid hemorrhage with persistent obtundation. The patient had an episode of increased ICP treated with Ativan. Evaluate for subclinical seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, Glargine, Pantoprazole, Gentamicin 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no clinical information provided as to whether or not the patient received sedative hypnotic medications. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a primarily discontinuous pattern. There are sections of the record, particularly when someone is working with the patient where there is a little bit more continuity. There are eye movements noted in the record. Eye movements are also seen when the EEG pattern is discontinuous. On most occasion tactile stimulation of the patient does not appear to impact the background. Sections of the record, particularly later sections in the record, on November 18, 2010, are lower voltage more suppressed. Additional data is reviewed on the November 18, 2010. The EEG at that time is much lower voltage, slower, and more discontinuous. 
HR: 70 BPM 
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there is clinical information provided, this EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function and should be correlated with imaging, presence or absence of vasospasm, and medications.
