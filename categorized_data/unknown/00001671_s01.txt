CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old woman with a seizure 18 years ago and then another a week ago with light-headedness.  The patient is startled and she drops things and has tonic-clonic activity with loss of consciousness and tongue biting.  Family history of epilepsy. The patient reported a different history to the technologist than was reported to Dr. Cooper including seizures only when missing medicines and when she takes cold tablets (antihistamines). The patient reported to the technologist that she has dizziness, then startle, then the tonic-clonic seizure with the incontinence and postictal confusion.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In apparent wakefulness, there is excess theta identified in the background, some of which is more prominent in the posterior regions.  There is a bit of head-rocking artifact on the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing.  Hyperventilation produces some prominent, rhythmic 5 Hz activity, which is not sustained, but it is a bit more prominent from the posterior regions than the anterior regions.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. 
HR:  54 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Excess theta.
	An unusual posteriorly predominant HV response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patientâ€™s medications would not be expected to produce the theta described above.  The posterior predominance in the HV response is a non-specific finding, but is not characteristic in this age group.
