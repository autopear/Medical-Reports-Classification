CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old woman with epilepsy for the past 15 years with tonic-clonic seizures and postictal confusion.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 20 V and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and there is a slight amount of left temporal theta seen in hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there are vertex waves and K complexes.  In the transition to and from stage II sleep, there are occasional left temporal sharp and slow wave complexes reaching amplitudes of 50 to 70 V.  These are discreet. 
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drowsy but does elicit a driving response. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Rare, left temporal sharp waves. 
Subtle focal slowing in hyperventilation.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No previous EEGs were available for comparison. This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.
