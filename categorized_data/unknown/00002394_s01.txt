CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 58-year-old male with alcohol abuse, DT, seizures, hypertension, CVA, status-post trache and PEG tube, hepatitis B and C, admitted with DT and seizures. Patient non-compliant with meds.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, thiamin, antihypertensives, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using  standard  10-20   system  of  electrode  placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not  performed.   The patient is agitated during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In  wakefulness, the  background EEG  is symmetric and continuous, but with excessive muscle movement artifact, significantly obscuring identification of the normal alpha rhythm.  As the recording continues, when the artifact subsides, a diffuse and excessively low voltage beta activity is seen.  Sleep is not achieved in this tracing.
HR:  102 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This is a limited EEG due to:
1.   Excessive movement artifact.
2.   Diffuse and excessive beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Due to the excessive muscle movement artifact, this EEG  is  limited  in  identifying  any  possible  epileptiform  discharges.    However, no significant epileptiform discharges correlated with this patieint' s behavior were seen on the video camera.  Diffuse and excessive beta activity may be due to medication such as benzodiazepine use. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
