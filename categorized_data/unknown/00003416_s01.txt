CLINICAL HISTORY: A 60-year-old male with global aphasia, right facial twitching 
following a stroke in 2004 and large left MCA CVA. Diabetes, hypertension, Ml, heart 
failure. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Hydralazine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy 
record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In early drowsiness the background EEG includes 
a slow alpha rhythm from the right ranging from 7-8 Hz but with a clear interhemispheric 
asymmetry with clear disruption of faster frequency activity from the left hemisphere and 
lower voltage rhythmic slowing on the left. Arousal of the patient produces agitation but 
the alpha rhythm on the right seems to be faster and the right background appears to be 
within the normal range. Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the 
interhemispheric asymmetry and the rhythmic slowing, particularly the left frontocentral 
region. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere characterized by slowing of the faster 
frequency or disruption of the faster frequency activity with rhythmic slowing on the 
right but no epileptiform activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. This EEG supports a 
structural abnormality on the left compatible with a stroke involving the cortex. 
Additional recording may be necessary to characterize epileptiform activity.
