CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 11-month-old male status-post five to ten minutes drowning episode in the bath. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, bicarb, and Versed. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The infant is intubated and comatose with occasional myoclonic jerks.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and includes a burst suppression pattern with an overall suppressed pattern and intermittent bursts of higher amplitude more sharply contoured activity, which are relatively symmetric.  In general, one to two bursts are seen Q 10 to 15 seconds with interburst flattening of approximately 15 seconds. Stimulation does not activate the record.  There is no variability. 
HR:  180 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	A burst suppression pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The burst suppression pattern could be seen in the setting of high dose Phenobarbital.  To more appropriately evaluate this pattern, knowledge of the patient’s levels is appropriate; however, if the levels are not high, this EEG supports a severe anoxic injury.  Knowledge of the duration of time since the patient’s anoxic injury is essential to place it in appropriate clinical context.
