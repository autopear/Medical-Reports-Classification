DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the background includes drowsiness or stage II sleep with generous beta activity.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Stimulation of the patient produces alerting with muscle, a very difficult to define posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 9 Hz, and a small degree of background theta.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep due to:
	1.	At least mild background slowing in wakefulness.
