CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old male with cystic fibrosis and multiorgan failure. This is a long-term eeg monitoring study. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Versed , Pantoprazole, Heparin, Insulin, Octreotide, 
Collagenase, Midorine, Meropenem, Pheylephrine, Norepinephrine 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is no clinical 
information provided. The patient appears to be intubated and comatose. He does 
receive Dilantin during the course of the record. Versed is stopped at 5 a.m. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record demonstrates a low 
Voltage (with subtle bursts low voltage periodic delta/beta of 0.5 secs.) featureless pattern. There is some ICU artifact and a little bit of muscle twitch 
artifact but no clinical movements. After the Versed is stopped, by 10 a.m., the EEG has 
returned to a previous pattern a very suppressed pattern with brief bursts of mixed 
alpha, theta, and a little bit of de frequency activity which lasts less than a second. 
These bursts are increasingly stereotypic over the course of the recording with this 
mixed frequent alpha and beta activity and are transitioning into a burst which is 1.4 Hz 
or about 0.6 seconds in duration is pattern seems to be abating by the afternoon of 
the 4th. No additional medic notes a made regarding any change in pharmacotherapy 
between 3 and 10 a. m. when the activity returns after Versed is stopped and the current 
pattern later at the end. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
l. Initially markedly suppressed pattern. 
2. A burst suppression pattern with low voltage activity seen from around 10 a.m.
