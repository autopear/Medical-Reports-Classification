HISTORY: 75 year old woman status post cardiac arrest early on the 5th, 
subsequently 12 hours later with myoclonic jerks of left arm, left leg, left face and coma. CT scan unremarkable. . 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Dopamine, Heparin, Lasix, Depacon, lorazepam, 
Tylenol 
INTRODUCTION Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
J system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and 
comatose. Â· 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, 
slow pattern with pulse artifact observed on the left. Occasional muscle 
is noted in the background. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not alter the record. 
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly slow, low voltage record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. No 
clinical events were noted. This EEG supports a severe, underlying encephalopathy. 
Correlation with imaging, clinical history, duration of cardiac arrest and doses of 
hypnotic medications would be valuable.
