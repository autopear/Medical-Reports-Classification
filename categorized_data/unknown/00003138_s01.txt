CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old male with 3 tonic-clonic seizures, transferred from 
Episcopal. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is agitated and poorly 
cooperative. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9Hz posterior dominant 
rhythm in a pattern with excessive beta. As the patient drifts off to sleep, he becomes 
less cooperative, there is an increase in beta. There is a small discrete sharp wave in 
the left temporal region. 
HR: 84 bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an unsatisfactory EEG due to the failure to obtain 
20 minutes of good recording. Please repeat this EEG as an outpatient so that we can 
more completely evaluate this patient's epileptiform focus.
