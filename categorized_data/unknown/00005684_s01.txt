CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old male with right hemiparesis, hematemesis and 
cerebral atrophy. 
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital l video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has difficulty 
following commands and is moving about during the study. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is one of beta and theta 
frequency activity. There is also 4 Hz rhythmic slowing picked up from the left temporal 
region. This is sharply contoured and can be seen as an interictal abnormality. There 
are sustained bursts of this, however, and It may represent an ictal phenomenon. It is 
not identified throughout the entire record but intermittently. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to: 
1. Rhythmic background slowing. 
2. Superimposed left temporal rhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional evaluation may be appropriate for this individual when he is able to cooperate.
