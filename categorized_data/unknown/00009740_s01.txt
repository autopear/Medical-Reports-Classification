CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old man with migraines and epilepsy for five years. Last seizure 
06/14/09. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Butalbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode 
placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation, hyperventilation performed. Awake through 
stage 2 sleep. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness, a minimally disorganized background 
is seen. The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8.5 to 9 hertz and up to 20 microvolt's. 
Throughout the record wicket waves are seen. Throughout the record bursts of irregular theta 
activity is seen which is higher amplitude on the left especially when the patient becomes 
drowsy or during hyperventilation. These bursts are sharply contoured with a question of an 
underlying sharp wave but none is ever seen. During stage 2 sleep vertex waves, K complexes 
and spindles are seen. During hyperventilation there is bilateral slowing and the increase in the 
sharply contoured bursts, irregular bursts theta. During photic stimulation driving is seen. 
HR 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slowing of the background 
2. Bursts of sharply contoured irregular theta activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Compared to the patient's previous study done here in 2005, the 
background slowing has improved. There was a question of an underlying sharp wave that 
never develops even through stage 2 sleep. A prolonged sleep EEG may be considered. 
There is no overall epileptiform activity or seizures, however, found in this record.
