CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old man PEA code for 20 minutes. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was intubated. In the beginning of the record the exhibited clinical jerking initially. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record begins, the patient was jerking rhythmically of the arms and legs with some oral facial chewing. Ativan 8 mg was given and then vecuronium. In the beginning of the record there is a burst suppression pattern. The bursts of activity are 25 to 40 seconds in duration in addition to muscle artifact. There is underlying periodic activity of approximately 1.5 Hertz. It is bilateral, initially frontotemporally predominant. With the use of the vecuronium, the muscle activity drops out and the cerebral pattern is one of well defined, bilateral frontotemporal periodic activity with delta. Most of the discharges were frontotemporally predominant but a few may have been frontocentral predominant. With the use of Ativan the periods of suppression were as long as 40 seconds. There was some slowing of the periodic activity but at the end of the record the patient remains in an epileptiform burst suppression pattern.  
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Status epilepticus. 
2. Burst suppression pattern. 
3. A pattern of post anoxic periodic complexes. 
4. Absence of reactivity or variability within the record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic for status epilepticus. The findings are characteristic of severe anoxic injury. Additional EEG recording was undertaken and a Versed drip was initiated .
