INTRODUCTION: 
62-year-old male found down, confused with left hemispheric 
Dilantin, Ativan. 
Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy 
record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is low voltage. There is 
somewhat relative symmetry in the beginning. Slightly higher in amplitude later on, on 
the left compared to the right. The background rhythm is a mix of delta and theta. The 
patient was moving during some of his study and becomes more drowsy toward the end 
where was found to have increased theta activity as well as some spindles. Heart rate 
70 beats per minute. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. low voltage and increased amplitude on the left compared to the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No 
epileptiform activity was identified. The absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude 
a diagnosis of epilepsy. Clinical correlation is recommended.
