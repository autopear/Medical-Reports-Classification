CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old male of unknown handedness, status post motor vehicle accident, ejected from the car on the 17th; now with temperature of 102 and shivering. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Gentamicin, Fentanyl, Pantoprazole, Ceftriaxone, Carafate 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated in a hard collar and somewhat agitated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a great deal of muscle. There is also some movement artifact. Despite artifacts, the background from the left includes a mixture of delta and theta. The recording from the right hemisphere is technically more challenging, and the technologist notes that the patient is shivering more on the right compared to the left. There does appear to be a bit more theta on the right compared to the left. 
HR: 126 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly slow background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The asymmetries described above may be artifactual but could be correlated with imaging. Focal and epileptiform features may have been under-recognized due to the degree of artifacts noted. If additional information is needed, a followup study when the patient is no longer shivering and is able to 
cooperate with testing is suggested.
