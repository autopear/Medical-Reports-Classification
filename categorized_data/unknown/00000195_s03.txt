CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male with recent left frontal surgery for oligodendrolglioma. The patient experienced a confusional spell today. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Klonopin, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow from the right hemisphere with excess theta and a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz. The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity in the frontal regions with a handful of left frontocentral sharp waves.  In addition, there is greater arrhythmic delta activity and at times a breach rhythm noted.   
Photic stimulation elicits a weak driving response on the right. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and disorganization. 
Superimposed focal slowing from the left frontal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Supportive of a structural abnormality on the left and a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform activity identified.
