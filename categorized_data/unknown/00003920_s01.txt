CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old male with adult onset generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy with the vagus nerve stimulator. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Tegretol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 to 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background rhythmic slowing followed by vertex waves.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a small degree of background slowing.  In stage II sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen.  
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  
HR:  70 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  To further characterize this patientâ€™s epilepsy, additional recording may be of use.
