CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old male with episodes of body shaking without loss of consciousness.  History of alcohol abuse and seizures.  Post-op day #16 â€“ evaluate for tremor.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vecuronium, Versed, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There is no mention as to whether or not the patient continues to have a craniectomy or whether or not the skull has been replaced.  He is trached, on a ventilator, and sedated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with arrhythmic delta activity.  It is somewhat featureless and there is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with a bit more slow arrhythmic delta on the right compared to the left.  The patient is examined during the EEG.  Stimulation of the patient produces a clear alerting response with an increase in theta, particularly on the left.  There are a handful of bursts of sharply contoured slowing in the left posterior quadrant, but no definite sharp waves. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Marked background slowing.
	Superimposed focal slowing with slower arrhythmic delta activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the patient is intubated, there is reactivity to stimuli elicited during the record and there is some variability.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Unfortunately, the episodes of tremor were not observed.
