CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 58-year-old male with alcohol abuse and epilepsy with a left subdural hematoma associated with a fall.  
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Phenobarbital, and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with a 10 Hz, 20 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit of left frontal rhythmic theta.  Other features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and subtly accentuates the left frontal theta.  Photic stimulation does not significantly impact the record. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Frontal theta primarily in the left.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The features seen above may be seen in the setting of a subdural hematoma or may be part of his underlying epilepsy.
