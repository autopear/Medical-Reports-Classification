CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 87-year-old woman with dementia and hypothyroidism who presented with change in mental status, facial twitching, as well as shaking of the extremities. 
MEDICATIONS: Aricept, Dilantin, Namenda, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with excess theta.  There is a subtle asymmetry, but with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity and a bit more slowing from the left hemisphere compared to the right.  Shivering is not associated with a change in the EEG.  Although there are occasional bursts of somewhat sharply contoured slowing from the left temporal region, there are no definite sharp waves.    Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR:  Greater than 100 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Subtle asymmetries with a bit more focal slowing on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter in the left hemisphere more significantly than the right.
