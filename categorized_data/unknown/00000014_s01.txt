	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	Epilepsy. Nineteen-year-old male status post MVA June 2 found to have left frontoparietal subdural hematoma, did not require surgery, was transferred back from rehabilitation service on the 15th after he had experienced a seizure.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Haldol, Ativan, Dilantin.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation are completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Much of the record includes a transition to and from stage 2 sleep with spindle activity. There is head-rocking activity identified in the occipital regions, right greater than left. Spontaneous arousals from sleep are observed. When the patient arouses from sleep, he is moving about and there is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact. When awoken he is confused. Occasional FIRDA is noted with stimulation of the patient.
HR: 96-104 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Clinical state of confusion with an inability to achieve awake and alert sleep.
	3. 	Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	In this individual with a significant amount of movement and rocking, there is a concern that there may be a bit more slowing from the right posterior region which would be a contrecoup pathology given the localization of the hematoma described above. No epileptiform features were seen. This EEG supports an underlying encephalopathy. Contributing
factors can include medications,  postictal  state, as well as the impact of this patient's head injury.
