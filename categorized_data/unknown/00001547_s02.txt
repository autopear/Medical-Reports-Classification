CLINICAL  HISTORY: This  is  a  74-year-old  woman  status-post   cardiac  arrest  in December  with  a single  seizure  at that time. Clinical  course  complicated  by  cerebral edema, now with issues of dementia, behavioral disorder, but no additional seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Low-dose Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital  video EEG  is  perfom1ed in the  lab  using  standard 10-20 system   of  electrode   placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG.  Photic  stimulation   was performed.   This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  RECORD: The  background  EEG  is  diffusely  slow,  low voltage.   There is some arrhythmic, sharply contoured delta activity in the right temporal region with suspicious underlying right mid and posteriotemporal sharp waves.
Features  of drowsiness  include slow rolling eye movements.    Photic  stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:  70BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnom1al EEG due to:
1.   Prominent background slowing.
2.   Shifting, but irregular, sharply contoured slowing from the right temporal region with associated sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests a predisposition for further seizures.
