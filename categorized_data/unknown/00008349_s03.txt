	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	43-year-old woman with epilepsy, last seizure more than a year ago, history of VST repair.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Depakote, Dilantin
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
This is an awake and drowsy record.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz,
50 mV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in CPAP. Hyperventilation does not significantly  activate the record. Post and vertex
waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. In the transition into and out of sleep, there is a single burst of polyspike and wave activity which is frontally predominant, high amplitude, and symmetric. Although there is only a single burst, the wave associated with this is approximately 5 Hz. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Definitive
2. High amplitude
3. Polyspike
4. Slow-wave complex.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	To be abnormal by conventional criteria, typically one must identify 2 epileptiform discharges. The single discharge identified today is high amplitude and clearly generalized, polyspike, and slow-wave complex. Thus, although there is only one discharge, this must be considered
epileptiform. If there are additional questions, comparison with
previous EEGs, none of which were available today, may be made.
