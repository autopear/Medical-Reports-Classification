INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and 
comatose. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates markedly 
abnormal, but continuous pattern of frontally predominant sharp wave contoured activity 
and a breech rhythm in the temporal regions. There is high amplitude rhythmic theta 
activity observed in the frontal regions with arrhythmic delta activity posteriorly. Tactile 
stimulation does appear to produce a change in the background with a decrease in 
amplitude. 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slow background with delta in the posterior regions and higher amplitude sharply 
contoured theta activity in the frontal regions. 
2. An unusual pattern of reactivity characterized by slowing or suppresses. 
CLINICAL COR RELATION: This EEG is compatible with this severe underlying 
encephalopathy, but there is cerebral activity. This EEG is not consistent with brain 
death.
