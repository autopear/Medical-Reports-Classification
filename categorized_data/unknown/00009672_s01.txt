CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year-old woman with epilepsy since age 10, last seizure 2
months ago. Seizures occur without loss of consciousness. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
are completed. The technologist had some technical challenges in that the patient has 
very oily hair. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 8 
Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal 
central beta activity. Features of sleep include: Drowsiness is characterized by slow 
rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha. Photic stimulation elicits: Scant 
driving. Hyperventilation elicits: Hyperventilation is performed early in the record with 
fair effort and without alteration of the background. 
HR: 72 bpm, slightly irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm. 
COR RELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. There were no 
previous EEG's available for comparison.
