CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 65-year-old woman found confused.  Past history of dementia, DM, HTN, and multiple strokes. 
MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient is frequently shaking her head from side to side. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, somewhat slow pattern with a low voltage 9 Hz alpha rhythm on the right and an asymmetry with a bit more slower 2 to 4 Hz activity on the left compared to the right.  Photic stimulation elicits asymmetric driving, more clearly identified on the right. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Modest background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing on the left. 
Unilateral driving. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  In addition, consideration for a process involving the left hemisphere more than the right is appropriate.  No epileptiform features were seen.
