CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old female subarachnoid hemorrhage with prolonged 
with elevated Intracranial pressure.  
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Pentobarbital, Versed, Vecuronium, Midazolam, Dilantin, 
Gentamicin, Pantoprazole, Ceftriaxone, Nimodipine, Labetalol. Pentobarbital in an on 
the 11/9/2010.  
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no 
indication regarding the patients response in terms of ICP.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to demonstrate a 
discontinuous pattern as was noted in the baseline prior to the initiation of the 
pentobarbital. The bursts of cerebral activity that are seen are now in the order of 2 to 3 seconds in duration. This suppression is very typically on the order of 3 seconds in 
duration. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record. The overall pattern is 
relatively symmetric, sometimes a little higher amplitude on the right compared to the 
left. There are no sustained discharges. As the recording continues, electrode integrity 
is declining. In addition, toward the close of the record, the patient is no longer in burst suppression.  
HR: 66bpm  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Medication induced burst-suppression 
resolves slowly after sedation discontinued. Abnormal background slowing and 
disorganized pattern was noted at the end of the LTM.
