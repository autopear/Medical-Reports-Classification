HISTORY: 26 year-old woman status post cardiac arrest on 5/2/08, now 
unresponsive with generalized cerebral edema. 
Dilantin, Solu-Medrol, Amiodarone, Protonix, Insulin, Desmopressin, 
Peripheral 
Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The recording is reviewed with 
standard montages as well as with CEA montage. In addition, due to artifacts, the 
patient is given pancuronium. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE There is no definitive cerebral activity observed. 
This patient is stimulated. The data is re-reviewed on multiple different morphologies. 
There is background artifact but no definite cerebral activity. Stimulation of the patient 
does not activate the record. There is no reactivity or variability observed. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Absence of definitive cerebral activity. 
CORRELATION: These results were communicated to the clinical team on 
6/6/08. In appropriate clinical context, these findings are compatible with 
electrocerebral silence and the most severe form of cerebral insult.
