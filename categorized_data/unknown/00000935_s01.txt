CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old male with epilepsy with seizure-related subdural hematoma. Past history of substance abuse. The patient had a seizure and injury 2 days before this EEG. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is rhythmic and relatively well-organized but medium to low amplitude. The alpha rhythm on occasion reaches 8 H but there is intermittent background slowing and there is a slight asymmetry with slightly lower amplitude activity on the left as compared to the right. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild excess theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The background theta may be due to postictal stale, medications or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
