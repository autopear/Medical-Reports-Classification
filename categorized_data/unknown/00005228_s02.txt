CLINICAL HISTORY: 85 year-old woman presented with seizure activity. She has a history 
of a past stroke of the right MCA territory and seizure disorder. She received Valium in the field 
and 2 mg of Ativan in the emergency room on arrival. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This patient is in the intensive care unit and is 
intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG continues to show a slow background more 
predominately on the left. On this record there are occasional right frontal spike waves. There 
is continued choreoathetotic movement with no EEG correlation. As the study continues, you to 
see these right frontal spike discharges again with no shoulder movement seen correlated with 
the discharges. 
1. Marked suppression of the left background. 
2. Sharp waves seen on the right frontal region 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: With this continuation of the slowing of background on the left 
there is concern of an acute left hemispheric focus. On the right hemisphere there is an area of 
sharp waves seen. The patient has history of a right MCA infarct in the past. The choreiform 
movements were are not associated with an EEG signature.
