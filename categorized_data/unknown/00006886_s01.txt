CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old male with chief complaint of dizziness. EMS called 
to home for possible general tonic-clonic seizure. Afterward patient confused. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Heparin, Protonix, Hydralazine, Insulin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record begins, a slow background is seen 
with a shifting asymmetry that is sometimes slower in the left hemisphere and at other 
times which is slower on the right hemisphere. At times, a posterior dominant alpha 
rhythm is seen sometimes reaching 8 Hz. During the record, intermittent generalized 
• delta activity is seen. 
• 
HR: 85 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slowing of the background focally left. and then seen in the right hemisphere. 
2. Generalized intermittent slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity or seizures recorded in 
this record. The generalized slowing and the shifting focality of slowing is nonspecific 
and can be seen in an encephalopathy of multiple etiologies including toxic metabolic 
and medication effect.
