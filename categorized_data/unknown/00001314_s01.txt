CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old lung transplant patient with right frontal hemorrhage and right arm myoclonus, as well as obtundation.  
MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, antibiotics, Dilantin, Prednisone.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive and described as having both a hemiparesis and asterixis.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background is markedly abnormal.  There is a pattern of more rhythmic theta and/or delta with some triphasic waves.  There are also occasional right central sharp waves identified in the record.  This can occur with brief trains, but reviewing the EEG, there is no jerking of the extremities in association with that discharge.  Later on in the video, the patient has some jerking of his head and shoulders, again without initially an EEG change although later a C4 sharp wave can be seen.  The jerking seems to be associated with an increase in the respiratory rate and the frequency does not match that of the C4 sharp wave.  As the recording continues, there are portions of the EEG where the right shoulder jerk is well defined, but it does not clearly correlate with the frequency of the discharge.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Generalized background slowing.
	Triphasic waves.
	The most prominent features are right central sharp and slow wave complexes with associated arrhythmic delta.  This does not have a consistent relationship with the right shoulder jerking.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although this EEG has metabolic features, in that the patient has a left hemiparesis, the right central spiking may in fact be related to the jerking elicited either through features of spread of the epileptiform focus or false focalization of this discharge.  The left shoulder may not be jerking simply because it is plegic.  Additional interventions and follow-up may be appropriate to further evaluate the right central spiking.
