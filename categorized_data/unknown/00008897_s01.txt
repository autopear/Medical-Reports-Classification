CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year-old male presented with changing mental status anoxic brain injury. Past medical history of anoxic brain injury, seizure. 
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Haldol, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG included low voltage, 
primarily flat EEG pattern in range of 4.5-6.0 hertz. Small amount of intermittent bursts of delta activity was also observed. Drowsiness is characterized by slow eye rolling movements. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background theta. 
2. Low voltage pattern with absence of normal awake morphologies. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptic features were observed. Absence of 
epileptiform does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. The patient is awake, but with generalized background slow EEG activity. This pattern is more consistent with chronic encephalopathy.
