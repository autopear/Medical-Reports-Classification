CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old, right-handed woman with epilepsy, previously on Dilantin now seizure-free for many years.  
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Trazodone, and Risperdal. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Photic stimulation is performed with good effort producing a small degree of bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation is associated with frequent eye blink, but no epileptiform features.  
HR:  70 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Previous EEGs were not available for comparison, but no epileptiform features were seen in this record.
