CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 13 with tonic-clonic activity, tongue biting, postictal confusion, but without incontinence. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, and Tegretol.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric, reactive 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central 3 to 5 Hz activity, as well as an increase in background beta.  Spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving response at 5 Hz and faster flash frequencies.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Although there is a vigorous driving response, there is no photo paroxysmal effect.  If indicated, additional testing may be helpful to characterize this patientâ€™s epilepsy.
