CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old woman admitted on the 21st with a seizure 
characterized by right-sided shaking and effusion and prolonged postictal Todd's 
paralysis, now conversant Right ICA aneurysm with bilateral stroke syndrome. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Labetalol, Insulin, HCTZ, Lisinopril, Folic Acid, Norvasc. 
Amovcicillin, Tamezepam 
INTROOUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant 
rhythm, best identified on the right but now returning on the left There is some 
occasional arrhythmic delta activity .or isolated focal delta in the right frontotemporal 
region. Intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity as well as rhythmic, sharply . 
contoured mixed theta and delta activities are seen on the left with a left frontotemporal 
phase reversal. 
The left hemisphere does consist of some alpha, theta and beta frequency activity. 
Occasional bursts of FIRDA are observed.. 
Drowsin.ess.is characterized by an increase in background slowing, but in wakefulness 
overall there i.:. . an increase in faster frequency activity on the left. 
In the transition toward stage 2 sleep there is an occasional left centrotemporal sharp 
wave observed. 
Unusual right fronto-temporal .theta appears in the EEG just prior to photic stimulation. It 
appears almost artifactual. 
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving at this time. The driving response is, however, 
much more vigorous on the right. The patient drifts off into stage 2 sleep during photic 
stimulation. 
HR: 84 bpm. 
Abnormal EEG due to:
