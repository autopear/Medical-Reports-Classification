CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old male admitted 6/18/2010, status post code 6/24/2010 and 7/5/2010. Readmitted 6/18/2010 with bacteremia. History of renal failure, diabetes, epilepsy and many other medical problems. 

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, Ativan, Tylenol, ASA, Heparin, Lorazepam, Daptomycin, Flagyl 

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is stimulated during the EEG. He is in strict isolation. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage slow pattern. Much of the EEG includes very slow, low voltage delta and theta but some sections have a scant amount of beta and alpha frequency activity. 

HR: 84 bpm 

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The small amount of variability described above is a positive prognostic factor, but to put this record into the appropriate clinical context, it is important to know the degree of pharmacologic sedation.
