CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 58-year-old male status-post MVA in February 2006 with epilepsy.  The patient has had EEGs dating to 2002 though he denies previous seizures, black outs, or strokes. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Norvasc. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, which does not significantly activate the record.  However, immediately post-hyperventilation, there is a bit of subtle focal slowing from the left hemisphere.   
Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. 
Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	An isolated burst of relatively sustained focal slowing seen following HV.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In the context of this patientâ€™s age, these findings are of unclear clinical significance.
