CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 58-year-old male with a five-year history of epilepsy 
associated with alcohol abuse. Patient was hit by a trolley three years ago suffering a 
cervical fracture, multiple cranial scars, and left rum paralysis. Last seizure was two 
months ago, nocturnal tonic-clonic seizure. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was 
performed. Tllis is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively 
low voltage, but there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is an intermittent 
asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the left and disruption of faster frequency 
on the right. This finding is seen throughout the right hemisphere, but is most prominent 
in the temporal regions. In addition, there are occasional left temporal sharp and slow 
wave complexes identified in wakefulness with variable maximum including T3, Tl, and 
TS. Rare, right centrotemporal sharp waves are also identified. Photic stimulation does 
not activate the record. 
HR: 66BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Higher amplitude, rhythmic theta from the left with well-defined left temporal sharp 
waves and spike and slow wave complexes with variable maximum. 
2. Right centrotemporal sharp waves, occasionally right mid-temporal. 
3. Background slowing from the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for 
epilepsy, as well as a bihemispheric process. Consideration for a previous craniotomy is 
appropriate.
