CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old gentleman with acute subdural hematoma and seizure like 
activity on the morning of the 10th characterized by right arm twitching and oral automatisms 
lasting 1-2 minutes. Renal failure. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Zofran, Ativan, Phenytoin, Pantoprazole, Kayexalate. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is wearing a hard collar. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal with a 
relatively high voltage, sharply contoured theta frequency pattern. In addition to muscle artifact, 
there are bursts of fast activity in the central regions. There is a bit more arrhythmic delta 
activity identified in the right posterior quadrant and there are some triphasic like wave forms 
that appear bilaterally in the posterior region. Generalized twitching is noted during the EEG 
with oral twitching observed. The oral, facial, and generalized twitching is not clearly associated 
with an epileptiform discharge. By the middle of the record, the twitching seems to have 
improved, but the EEG actually does continue to pick up some subtle twitch artifact. 
HR: 132 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly abnormal high voltage paroxysmal slow pattern. 
2. Occasional triphasic waves which have an unusual field of spread. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The patient's twitching does not carry an EEG signature and in 
fact even when the patient seems to have stopped twitching at the bedside the EEG continues 
to pick up some more subtle twitching. Although this is a markedly abnormal background, the 
overall appearance is most compatible with a metabolic encephalopathy. If addition questions 
remain, additional EEG recording when the patient's metabolic issues have resolved may be 
helpful. There is a bit more arrhythmic delta in the right posterior region which may be 
correlated with imaging.
