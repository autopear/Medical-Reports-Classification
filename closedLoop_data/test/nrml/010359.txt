CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old woman with end stage renal failure who began to 
have focal seizures from the right hemibody on the night of the 13th. Received Ativan, 
Haldol, Dilantin and is now poorly responsive with right arm weakness. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Lisinopril, Minoxidil, Metoprolol, ASA, Nephro-vite, Calcium, 
Simvastatin, Catapres 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation or 
photic stimulation. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow. It is 
primarily a 7 to 8 Hz theta pattern. There are clear changes noted as the patient 
transitions in and out of sleep. Vertex waves and spindle activity is noted as she 
transitions to sleep. Spontaneous arousals are noted. No clinical seizures are observed 
during the EEG. There is shifting slowing, but in this individual with a right arm 
monoparesis, there is little in the way of focal slowing from the left. At the end of the 
record, the patient is a bit restless and this restlessness is seen as she transitions in 
and out of sleep. 
HR: 78bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Shifting slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most supportive of a generalized process. 
There are no epileptiform features. In this individual with focal findings on exam, there 
is no major focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
