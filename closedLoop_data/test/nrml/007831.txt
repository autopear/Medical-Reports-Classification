CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 20-year-old male with a gunshot wound to the left eye, left temporal parietal craniotomy, seizures every month with tonic-clonic activity and postictal confusion. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a prominent breach rhythm identified with higher amplitude activity in the left temporal region in comparison to the right.  The activity on the right is relatively low voltage, but does appear to demonstrate some low voltage theta and a poorly defined posterior dominant rhythm.  From the left, the primary frequencies are theta and delta.   
Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic background slowing and include spreading of the focal slowing to the left central and posterior temporal regions. 
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in the amplitude of the focal slowing on the left.  Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to:
Focal slowing from the left temporal region with an underlying breach.
Modest background slowing from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports not only a diffuse disorder of cerebral function, but also a structural or functional abnormality on the left. No epileptiform features were seen.  Correlation with imaging may be useful regarding the bihemispheric nature of abnormalities.
