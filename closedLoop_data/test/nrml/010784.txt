CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 33-year-old woman with epilepsy since the age of three 
with a family history of seizure disorder. Last seizure was about one week ago after drinking 
and stress with tonic-clonic activity and loss of consciousness with postictal confusion 
without urine or bowel incontinence or tongue biting. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
were performed. This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric 
and well organized for age. There is 9 to 11 Hz, 40 u V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, 
which is well attenuated with eyes opened. There is a small amount of low voltage, 
frontocentral beta activity. Soon after the tracing begins, a burst of spike and slow wave 
activity is seen diffusely, which lasted for about 2 to 4 seconds. This burst activity increased 
during hyperventilation, post-hyperventilation, and during photic stimulation. However, it 
decreased in stage II sleep. Sleep is evidenced by a mixed frequency of brain activity, vertex 
waves, spindles, and K complexes. Occasionally, T3 and T4 sharp and spike wave activity is 
seen. Photic stimulation elicits driving. 
HR: 60BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Burst of generalized spike and slow wave activity at 3 Hz, lasting for 2 to 4 seconds. 
2. Occasional spike and sharp activity in the left or right temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a pathological process 
involving the cortex as well as the deeper nuclei in the subcortical area. It is suggestive of a generalized epilepsy plus possible multifocal epilepsy.
