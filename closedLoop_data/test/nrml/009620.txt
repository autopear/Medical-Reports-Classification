CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed male with history of polysubstance abuse and seizures with previous abuse of cocaine, Xanax, PCP, opiates, and alcohol.  He presents to Episcopal with seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed, Fentanyl.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The EEG is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  No activation procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse to slow EEG with posterior dominant rhythm best seen at 7 Hz with low amplitude, some increased frontal central beta.  Some stage changes are noticed, but not characteristics stages of sleep are noted.  No activating procedures are done. 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous T4 electrode artifact with some movement artifact.
ABNORMAL DIFFICULTIES:  Generalized slow waves. 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  This may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
