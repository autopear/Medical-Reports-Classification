CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old male with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and 
head trauma in 1994. Remote history of seizures in 2004, now recurring May of 2009. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, Metformin, Lexapro, Clozaril, HCTZ 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation are 
performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates excess background 
theta. In addition, there is an amplitude asymmetry of higher amplitude 5-7 Hz activity at the 
midline as well as left frontocentral. The posterior dominant rhythm ranges from 9-10 Hz. 
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, accentuating the rhythmic slowing at the 
left central region, left hemisphere. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements 
and an increase in beta. Patient is somewhat fidgety as he drifts off to sleep. Hypnagogic 
hypersynchrony is observed in the transition to sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Modest excess theta and disorganization. 
2. Focal features including increased theta on the left and an amplitude asymmetry at the 
midline. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings should be correlated with imaging and previous 
craniotomy history. There were no epileptiform features, but the focal features may correlate 
with his previous trauma. The generalized background slowing may be related to the head 
trauma or the medications.
