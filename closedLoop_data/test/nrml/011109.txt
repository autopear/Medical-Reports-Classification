CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old gentleman with epilepsy in the 1970s following an 
motor vehicle accident. The patient was evaluated by the VA Medical Center. He had 
increasing seizures and Dilantin was added to Depakote. He has subsequently had 
increasing seizures, left frontal encephalomalacia, rash, fever. 
Clindamycin, Vancomycin, Benadryl, Keppra. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a technically challenging 
record due to the oiliness of the patient's scalp. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background includes a somewhat slow, 
mixed frequency pattern with primarily theta frequency activity. There is higher 
amplitude activity on the left compared to the right. Features of drowsiness include an 
increase in beta. The patient is very uncomfortable during the EEG. Sometimes he 
started to drift off to sleep with vertex waves and then snore artifact. There does appear 
to be a breech rhythm and some focal slowing picked up in the left frontotemporal 
region. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing. 
2. An asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with higher amplitude activity on the left. 
CLINICAL When the patient's rash is better and better scalp integrity 
can be obtained, a follow-up study is suggested if he continues to have frequent 
seizures.
