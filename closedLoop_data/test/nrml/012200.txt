CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old male with intracerebral hemorrhage; admitted to 
Memorial Hospital after a fall, had a seizure at the outside hospital and was found to 
right parenchymal and extra-axial hemorrhage. Past history of seizures at age 13, 
and perinatal spinal meningitis. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Famotidine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is not intubated and Is 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely 
poorly organized pattern although it is relatively rich in theta and some alpha 
The major abnormalities in this record are high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp 
wave or spike and slow wave complexes. some of which occur in bursts and trains 
which have clear frequency evolution. There is clear variability in the record with 
from more of an alpha-theta frequency pattern to a slower pattern. There is also an 
asymmetry. The activity from the left hemisphere is higher amplitude than the right. 
HR: 100bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. High amplitude left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave and spike and slow 
complexes occurring in bursts and trains. 
2. Left anterior temporal arrhythmic and rhythmic delta. 
3. Generalized background slowing. 
4. An asymmetry with lower voltage activity on the right compared to the left. 
Although the history suggested a right-sided cerebral 
is prominent epileptiform activity from the left. Consideration for additional EEG or at 
least a follow-up study in 24 hours, is suggested.
