CLINICAL HISTORY:  30 year old male with herpes encephalitis
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, Acyclovir, Ceftriaxone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent but is stimulated during the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG continues to demonstrate an abnormal pattern.  There is a continuous periodic complex in the right hemisphere with
a generous field of spread.  The epileptiform complex is variable.  Sometimes it is maximum in the midtemporal regions, other times right frontal central.  The aftergoing slow waves may have a positivity in the right or frontotemporal region.  Much of the record includes stage II  sleepless spindle activity and this complex persists all the way through.  Stimulation of the patient clearly elicits an arousal.
	HR:	96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Continuous periodic complex without definitive frequency of elution.
	2.	Marked background slowing.
	3. 	Arrhythmic  delta activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is improved compared to previous studies. There is clearly a defined awake and stage II  sleep.  The epileptiform activity is quite prominent and ongoing. Observation and/or intervention may be appropriate.
