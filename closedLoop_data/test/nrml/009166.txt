CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed female with epilepsy, noncompliant with medication now with status epilepticus. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern with generous beta. There is some lower voltage sharply contoured slowing maximum at T1. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal response and a low voltage left temporal sharp wave can be identified with stimulation. Eye blink artifact is noted. As the recording continues, there is an amplitude symmetry noted with higher amplitude beta observed in the left frontocentral region although there is no suggestion of a breach rhythm. There is no mention of a craniotomy. Brief stage II sleep is observed. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Low voltage pattern. 
3. Overall background slowing. 
4. Suspicious sharp waves observed primarily in the left temporal region, but low voltage discharges nonetheless. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background beta may be due to this patient's medications. The beta asymmetry and the sharply contoured slowing may be correlated with imaging.
