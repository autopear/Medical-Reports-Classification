CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 69-year-old male with a shower of cerebral emboli last week, associated with tonic-clonic seizures, alcohol abuse, and dementia.  MRI demonstrates right temporal abnormality. The patient left the hospital on Sunday, refused to come back, came back with UTI and recurrent seizures having been noncompliant with his Dilantin.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Trileptal, antibiotics.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with some shifting asymmetries.  At times there is some arrhythmic delta from the left temporal region and at other times there is some arrhythmic delta from the right.  The focal slowing and background disorganization is variable for this individual.   
Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR: 90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Arrhythmic delta, which can be seen from the right or left temporal regions, somewhat more prominent from the left in the beginning of the record, but seen more from the right in the later sections. 
	Background disorganization. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The overall background is markedly improved compared to previous studies.
