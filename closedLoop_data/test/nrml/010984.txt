	\CLINICAL HISTORY: 	57  year-old with anxiety disorder, left cholesteatoma in July
2008. Evaluate for change in mental status. Cerebellar hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and declining mental status. VP shunt.
MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine,  Metoprolol, :Labetalol, Vancomycin,  Aranesp, Gentamicin,  Sertraline,  Dilantin, Amlodipine, Meropenem, Lovenox, Zofran
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1   channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, background EEG demonstrates an
alpha rhythm, better identified on the left in comparison to the right and averaging 6- 7 Hz. There is frontal, arrhythmic delta activity which is more irregular in the left frontal
region in comparison to the right. Breech rhythm is suggested on the left with higher amplitude activity in this region.
	HR:	90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
	2.	Superimposed amplitude asymmetry with increased activity on the left compared to the right.
	3.	Frontal delta.
	CLINICAL CORRELATIOIN:	These findings may be correlated with imaging. The high amplitude rhythmic frontal delta, left greater than right, may be seen in the context of hydrocephalus.   No epileptiform features were observed.
