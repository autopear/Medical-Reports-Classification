CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old woman with subdural hematoma, status post bur 
hole to drain the subdural hematoma one week ago. The patient's initial presenting 
symptoms were ataxia and generalized weakness. On March 15, she developed 
confusion with aphasia but imaging failed to identify new focal features. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Seroquel, Zofran, Celexa, Remeron. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates an intra 
hemispheric asymmetry. The activity from the right is reasonably organized with a theta 
frequency, posterior dominant rhythm. A small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta 
and occasional delta. The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic 
delta and amplitude asymmetry and some sharply contoured delta at T1 . There is little 
in the way of drowsiness but features of drowsiness included decrease in eye opening 
and a bit of slow rolling eye movements as well as increasing delta from the left. 
HR: 70 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild background slowing. 
2. Superimposed focal slowing on the left with disruption of fast or frequency activity 
and sharply contoured delta with a T1 maximum. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality in the left 
hemisphere involving both gray and white matter. Although there were no definite sharp 
waves or spikes, there was sharply contoured delta. If there are paroxysmal behavioral 
changes, EEG monitoring should be considered.
