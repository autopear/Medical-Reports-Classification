CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 4-year-old male with intermittent staring spells, unresponsive to the mother for three to five seconds at a time, occurring three to five times per day.  History of asthma, otherwise normal birth and development. 
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has multiple clinical spells in wakefulness and in sleep.  These are evaluated by the tech and testing is performed to assess responsiveness. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins with the BIOCAL in the first few seconds of the EEG, high amplitude generalized spike and wave activity is seen.  The activity is seen in the first ten seconds of the EEG and occurs in wakefulness.  The recording that follows includes a somewhat drowsy pattern.  There is intermittent occipitally predominant rhythmic delta activity, which is sometimes a bit more prominent on the left than the right. 
The first well-defined seizure with seizure onset is at 13:08:26.  The child is sitting comfortably.  As is the case with the additional awake seizures, he raises his arms and does not speak.  Testing is performed.  The child speaks afterwards.  He doesnâ€™t seem to be entirely out of it during the spells.  The EEG demonstrates a generalized, 3 to 4 Hz spike and slow wave complex.  This very first spell seems to be a bit more remarkable in the left compared to the right.  There seems to be a little sharp wave that precedes on the left prior to the generalized discharge. The tech started hyperventilation when the first event occurred.  She gives the patient a code word during the first spell and responsiveness is impaired.  During the second seizure at 13:10:06, the patient is given a color.  Once again, he is noted to just very gently raise his arms above his head.  This discharge is similar to the previous with frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity and poly spike and slow wave activity with abrupt cessation when the event is over.  This one seems to be more synchronous with fast activity seen in the frontal regions, but again has just the slightest bit of focality to the left at the onset.  The third seizure occurs at 13:14:00 following hyperventilation.  This seizure is shorter (most seizures are 20 seconds in duration, this one is 14 seconds).  He lifts his leg gently and puts it back down, but the previously described behavior was not seen with the arms.  Additional seizures including that at 13:16:06 occur when the child is asleep.  The epileptiform activity is essentially identical with a very high amplitude, at times greater than 200 msc spike and slow wave discharges.  This is bilateral, but again there is a bit more intense fast activity in the left frontal region than the right.  Following this, the patient is drowsy but not entirely asleep, although there is some stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the drowsy pattern, there is a bit of fast activity in the frontocentral regions.  The fifth seizure is at 13:18:36 with the patient drifting off to sleep.  No clinical signs are seen for this drowsy individual, but testing is not performed with the intention to let the child fall asleep.  Immediately after the discharge, a vertex wave can be seen supporting the appearance of this activity as the child drifts off to sleep.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The sixth seizure is recorded in stage II sleep at 13:22:46, ending at 13:32:56.  No clinical signs or symptoms are noted with this.  Additional, brief or less than 10 second discharges are also seen in sleep.  There are a handful of poly spike discharges noted in this sleep record, but mostly it is the longer discharges.  An additional discharge is observed at 13:27:36, which seems to slightly disrupt sleep.
Stimulation does not elicit a photoparoxysmal response.
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Spontaneous and hyperventilation-induced frontally predominant bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity.
Rare bursts of fast activity from the left frontal region in sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: On the whole, this EEG is most supportive of a primary generalized mechanism for epilepsy with frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  There are some features raising the possibility of a secondarily generalized mechanism including the left frontal activity seen at the onset of this.  This may represent the orientation of the dipole for this individual.  The seizures that occurred were relatively typical of absence seizures.  Correlation with clinical history and imaging is appropriate.  
Of note, the attending physician of record was notified during the EEG.
