CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male with poorly controlled diabetes and 
hyperglycemic seizures. Yesterday the patient was admitted with a glucose of 533 
associated with 3 seizures, treated with Dilantin and Ativan. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lovenox, Insulin, Thiamine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy 
record in an individual who is relatively somnolent. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the background 
EEG demonstrates a drowsy pattern. With stimulation, there is a 7 hertz posterior 
dominant rhythm. In the transition to drowsiness, bursts of frontally predominant delta 
are followed by brief vertex spikes and spindles and then arousals. By the close of the 
record, the patient is increasingly alert, but the background remains a bit slow. 
HR: 66 bpm 
Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild slowing of the alpha rhyth111. 
2. Mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL No epileptiform seizures are observed in this record. The 
background slowing described above may be due to this patient's postictal state or 
medications. No epileptiform seizures were observed today. Normal EEG does not 
exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, and if seizures are an important consideration a repeat 
tracing is advised.
