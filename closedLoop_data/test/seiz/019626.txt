CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 31-year-old male with a cocaine-induced seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Immunization, Dilantin, and Ambien. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is at the limits of organization for a subject of this age and includes a 7.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits a brief driving response at faster flash frequencies.
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and may be due to medications or postictal state. No epileptiform features were seen in this record.
