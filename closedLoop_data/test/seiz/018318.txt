CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old woman with epilepsy since age six, seizure-free for several years, but now having a seizure every four months described as strange smells, then hearing bells, loss of consciousness with shaking, tongue biting, and incontinence with postictal confusion.  HIV positive. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Carbatrol, and others (patient unable to name).   
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is sharply contoured, high amplitude with an 11 Hz, 50 to 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a fair amount of eye blink and movement, but there is also some underlying posterior slowing in the posterior regions bilaterally.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing intermittent bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta as well as some bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta.  Towards the close of hyperventilation, the focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant is a bit more prominent than that on the left.  In this sharply contoured background, there are suspicious, left anterior temporal sharp waves.  
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving, which is again sharply contoured.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Sharply contoured background but with excess background slowing and a small degree of disorganization. 
Posterior slowing, right greater than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are suspicious sharp waves identified in the temporal regions.  Given the sharply contoured background and the amount of EKG artifact, to further characterize this patientâ€™s epilepsy, a repeat study capturing sleep is recommended.
