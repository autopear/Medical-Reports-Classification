CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old male with right foot gangrene, right sided weakness. 
MEDICATIONS: Clonidine, ASA, Darbepoetin, Percocet, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated on warming blanket and somewhat restless. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite significant muscle and movement artifact, there is an underlying, definable cerebral pattern which includes rhythmic 3-5 hertz activity and some frontal delta. The degree of muscle artifact precludes an assessment in terms of asymmetry, but there is a suggestion of lower voltage pattern on the left compared to the right. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in motor activity. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These finding are nonspecific and can be seen in the contest of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as other diffuse disturbances of cerebral function. If there is any concern about seizures, a followup study when the patient is out of the ICU may be of value.
