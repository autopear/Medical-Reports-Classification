CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-week infant now at 37 weeks gestation. Infant was ready to be discharged when she began to have episodes of gagging and aspiration. Subsequently she went on to have seizures characterized  by jerking of the left arm. She has had problems with intermittent desaturation, having suffered an aspiration as well. Exam notable for movement of all extremities but less so in the left arm.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Ativan, Dilantin. Others.
INTRODUCTION:  Prolonged digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the neonatal ICU using neonatal montage. The child was examined extensively during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, the child is receiving Dilantin. Over the course of the recording, the clinical seizures which are characterized by jerking movements of the left arm abate. There are periodic sharp waves observed in the central regions including C3, CZ, and C4, and the sharp waves seem to be at the midline or to the left despite the left arm jerking.
Clinically, after the left focal seizures resolve, the infant has occasional myoclonus without any EEG correlate. She also has episodes of desaturation which are associated with stiffening but without an EEG change. After the clinical seizures resolve, there are occasional sharp waves in the background. In addition, delta brushes are observed, some of which are asynchronous, a bit more so on the left than the right. The child and the EEG are both reactive to stimuli. Awake status is recorded, and the normal developmental milestones for a child of this age are identified. The overall pattern after the seizure resolves is relatively symmetric with delta brushes, a continuous pattern in an infant moving all extremities but the left arm less so.
Heart rate: N/A IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal EEG due to focal seizures characterized by left arm jerking with sharp waves from the central regions, in this context a focus that is close to the midline in the central regions.
2.  L Central sharp wave.
3.   CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for seizures. Ongoing seizures were not recorded. These findings were discussed with the clinical team at the bedside.
