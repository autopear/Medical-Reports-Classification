CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 73-year-old male with dementia, parkinsonism, bipolar disorder, aphasia, and seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Amantadine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous, relatively symmetric with diffuse theta activity ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 Hz and small amounts of delta.  There is some asynchronicity, but little in the way of shifting asymmetries.   As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background delta. Deep stages of sleep are not achieved.  
HR:  72 to 84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a study done 11/03, this EEG demonstrates a small increase in the background slowing.  Like the other EEG, no epileptiform features were seen.
