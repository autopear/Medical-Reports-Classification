CLINICAL HISTORY:43-year-old woman with epilepsy after an MVA in 1970. 
Seizure free for 5-10 now with a breakthrough seizure February 2008 and 
subsequently multiple hospitalizations. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
are performed. This is an awake and sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is appropriately 
organized with 10-Hz, 40-microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of 
low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record 
producing an increase in the amplitude of the background. Features of drowsiness 
include slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. 
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal 
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
