HISTORY: 35 year-old with multiple severe medical problems, renal failure 
and status post transplant, anemia, admitted with obtundation, facial twitching and a 
convulsion. 
MEDICATIONS: Flagyl, Dilantin, Rocephin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is disorganized, diffusely slow. 
There is a mixture of theta and delta. Occasional right central sharp waves are 
identified. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity. 
Shifting asymmetries are observed. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing and disorganization. 
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta. 
3. C4 sharp waves. 
CLINICAL This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral 
function affecting gray and white matter. Consideration for localization related 
mechanism for seizures is appropriate.
