CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 52-year-old m ale with hypertension,  MI, 1ung cancer, now experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures while awake.  Patient remains awake through these events.  History of childhood epilepsy and non-epileptic seizures in 2002.
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Dilantin, Tegretol, Dilaudid, and others.
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has one of his typical spells during the EEG.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness,  there  is  a  10  Hz,  30  uV  posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient tells the tech at 10:17, ''I feel a little funny."  He then says that he has an aura of vision going white.  He has jiggly movements with rhythmic movements of the right face and right arm,  but purposeful movements of the left.  He communicates initially with the tech and then later has generalized movements, thrashing about in the bed.  He consistently
pushes down with his right hand and lifts his body up with his left.  He thrusts his pelvis over to the right.  This motor activity abates at 11:18:43.  The tech has given the patient a code word to remember.  He breathes  heavily.  The EEG,  during this spell, is remarkable for a normal alpha rhythm. There is muscle and movement artifact, but afterwards, theEEG  demonstrates a normal awake pattern.  The patient is somewhat responsive to the tech afterwards.
HR.:  70BPM.
IMPRESSION: Remarkable EEG: behavior event without EEG change.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background is similar to previous studies.  The behavior in question has no EEG signature and does not appear to be a seizure.
