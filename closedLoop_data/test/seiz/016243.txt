CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year-old-male with epilepsy, alcohol abuse, schizophrenia, 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Evaluate for continuous video EEG monitoring. 
MEDICATIONS: Vecuronium, Ativan, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates generous diffuse 
background beta activity with underlying delta. There is a small asymmetry with a bit 
more delta in the right hemisphere compared to the left. The beta is relatively 
symmetric. There are spontaneous arousals with muscle. Later on the record there are 
some portions with shifting asymmetries in the beta. 
HR: 96 to 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with primarily a beta frequency pattern. 
2. Shifting delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today. There is 
evidence of arousal in this record, suggesting that this patient's pharmacologic, and 
paralysis are wearing off.
