CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year-old gentleman with "seizures" dementia.
 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. The patient is described as postictal and somnolent. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with a 
mixture of lower voltage beta and delta. As the recording continues, there is an increase in alpha frequency activity and with a bit more spontaneous movement. Stimulation of the patient also produces a clear change in the background with an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity and occasional question of asymmetry with more of a beta on the right. The overall background of the patient is unstimulated, is diffusely so, but there is a suggestion of a bit more slowing on the right. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR: 72 bpm, slightly irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing. 
2. Superimposed intermittent focal slowing on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed due to the 
background slowing. Additional recording may be important.
