CLINICAL HISTORY: 58-year-old male who had a slip and fall incident and tonic 
clonic seizure with an orbital fracture. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Methadone, Seroquel, Glipizide, Clonopin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 20-10 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy 
record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 to 10 hertz posterior 
dominant rhythm with a modest amount of low voltage, frontomental beta activity. 
Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta. Other features include 
slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not 
performed. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits. 
CLINICAL No focal nor epileptiform features are observed, however, 
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important 
consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is advised.
