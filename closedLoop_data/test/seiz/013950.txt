CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 45-year-old male with an episode of unresponsiveness while sitting in a chair.  Previous seizure one week ago.  History of epilepsy and schizophrenia.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Lamictal. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized with diffuse background theta.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 Hz and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There are occasional left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes as well as some discrete, right anterior temporal lower voltage, fast activity or sharp waves.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in the background slowing. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  
During photic stimulation, in between the discharges, there are bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant sharp and slow wave complexes or there is a single burst, but photic stimulation itself was only associated with driving.  There is intermittent left anterior temporal focal slowing, as well as sharp waves. There is smaller, low amplitude, right frontotemporal poly spike or discrete sharps and there are isolated bursts of frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  Photic stimulation elicits brief driving but no definite spike/wave
Hyperventilation produces a mild degree of background slowing.
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slowing and sharp waves.
Right frontotemporal more discrete sharp waves.
A single generalized epileptiform burst.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial or localized mechanism for epilepsy.  The patientâ€™s previous Temple EEG records were not available for comparison at this time.
