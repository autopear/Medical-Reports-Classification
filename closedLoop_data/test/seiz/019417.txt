CLINICAL HISTORY: 71-year-old woman with adult onset epilepsy, seizure-free for many years with memory problems in the context of an otherwise bright, elderly woman.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-formed alpha rhythm averaging 8 to 8.5 Hz, 40 uV.  There is occasional right or left temporal theta, left greater than right.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces some arrhythmic delta more prominent from the left temporal region.  There is also some wicket activity identified. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing with occasional vertex waves and spindles seen in sleep.  There are spontaneous arousals from sleep.   
Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
	1.	Excessive temporal theta and delta, which is at times sharply contoured. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this EEG.  Of note, it is often difficult to find epileptiform activity in elderly individuals with epilepsy.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
