CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male with tonic-clonic epilepsy since age 20.  History of head trauma at age 13.  Occasionally non-severe tonic-clonic seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, and Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is some subtle slowing with primarily theta frequency activity picked up in the posterior regions, slightly more so on the left than the right.   Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit more irregularity in the right hemisphere compared to the left.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmicity of the background, and the subtle focal features previously described are not quite as prominent.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving bilaterally, somewhat more intense on the right.
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
	1.	Subtle irregular slowing in the posteriotemporal regions, right greater than left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  There is a slightly more vigorous driving response in the right compared to the left at faster frequencies, raising the possibility of a breach rhythm, although none is reported with examination of the scalp.
