CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old male with multiple medical problems, loss of consciousness, head trauma and glucose of 501. 
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Dilantin, Plavix, Lipitor 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very agitated, trying to get out of bed despite the presence of physician, nurse and EEG tech at the bedside. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Underneath a significant amount of muscle and motion artifact the EEG demonstrates a relatively symmetric, continuous mixed frequency slow background with delta, beta activity and smaller amounts of theta. There is no well-defined alpha rhythm. The patient's episodes of agitation are not associated with a particular EEG signature. 
HR: 140 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are nonspecific in nature and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as other, diffuse disturbances of cerebral dysfunction.
