CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old woman with tonic-clonic seizures x 2.  Past history of epilepsy but currently on no medications, schizophrenia, and cocaine abuse as well as benzodiazepine ingestion. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Trazodone, Seroquel, Zoloft.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by symmetric, rhythmic theta.  
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in theta.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving at lower and faster flash frequencies with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep or using special electrodes could be useful.
