CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 45-year-old male found unresponsive with seizures.  History of COPD.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, and antibiotics.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed due to the patientâ€™s medical condition. The patient is agitated and combative during the recording. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage with significant beta activity and muscle movement artifact, but basically symmetric.  
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Replacement of normal background with low voltage pattern with diffuse beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The beta activity may be due to medication such as Ativan.  Epileptiform activity may be missed due to the muscle artifact.  A repeat EEG when the patient is more cooperative is recommended.
