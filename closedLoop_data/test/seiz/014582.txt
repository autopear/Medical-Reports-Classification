HISTORY: 25 yr old male with new onset tonic clonic seizures. History of left ocular trauma.  Patient admitted for new onset seizures and then became Dilantin toxic and was unsteady.
MEDICATION: Dilantin,Heparin, others.
ACTIVATION: Hyperventilation and Photic Stimulation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-
20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz,  30uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, as the patient is awakened from sleep and produces prominent bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing.  There is also a suggestion of left temporal sharp waves seen in the portion of the record following.  Drowsiness is characterized by generous background beta with vertex waves and spindles in stage II sleep.
HR:   80BPM
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Suspicious left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  The prominent response, which was sustained after hyperventilation, is of unclear clinical significance.  It may have been accentuated by the patient's  Dilantin toxicity.  This bedside portable EEG may be followed up by a repeat study to clarify the abnormalities described above.
