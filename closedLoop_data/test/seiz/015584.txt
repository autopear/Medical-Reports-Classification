CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 44-year-old male with temporal lobectomy and seizures.  
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly asymmetric, with a moderate increase in the amplitude and fast activity on the background with slow theta in the right hemisphere especially at the temporal region suggestive of a breach rhythm.  The background is moderately attenuated.  There is an 8.5 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is attenuated with eyes opened. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Sleep is evidenced by a mixed frequency of brain activity, as well as an increase in the amplitude and slow activity in the background.  However, deeper stages of sleep were not achieved in this tracing. In light sleep, the background became more symmetric.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	A breach rhythm in the right hemisphere especially in the temporal area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breach rhythm is a skull defect due to brain surgery.  However, no epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
