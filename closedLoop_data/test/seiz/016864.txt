CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 59-year-old male with a seizure a month ago, strictly nocturnal seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and another seizure medicine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 7.5 to 8 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does not activate the record.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta and delta.  Occasional vertex waves are seen.  
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These features are non-specific and may be related to medication effect.
