CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old male with past head trauma, nocturnal tonic-clonic 
seizures, multiple per week, characterized by awakening with soreness and fatigue with 
one day post ictal, several per month. Remote history of alcohol and dru g abuse. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Prozac 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using the standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. Hyperventilatio n and photic 
stimulation are completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized. 
There is a 10 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, 
frontal-central beta activity. Head rocking artifact is picked .up in the right occipital scalp 
region. In this individual with post-traumatic epilepsy, there is no note that there was 
previous cranial defect in that area. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. 
Hyperventilation produced a small amount of theta. 
HR; 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG 
CLINICAL No focal Nor epileptiform features are identified in this 
record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy because this is simply an 
awake and drowsy record. A repeat tracing showing deeper stages of sleep may be 
helpful in characterizing epileptiform activity.
