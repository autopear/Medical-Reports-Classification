CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 84-year-old male with a history of fluctuating  mental status with increased episodes of unresponsiveness.  Metastatic prostate cancer.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, steroids, insulin, and Theophylline. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Generous amounts of muscle movement artifact obscure part of the record.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  86 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG for a patient of this age. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform discharges were seen.  If seizures are in important consideration, a repeat tracing as an outpatient under sleep deprived conditions in order to capture deeper stages of sleep is appropriate.
