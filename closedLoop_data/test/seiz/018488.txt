CLINICAL HISTORY: 48-year-old male with heart failure and a pacemaker on hemodialysis. Patient had a PEA code 9:03 AM on 11/03/04, received Ativan & Dilantin. 
MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl (discontinued 11/03), Epogen, Flagyl, and Dobutamine. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is composed of nearly continuous rhythmic 6 to 7 Hz theta activity.  There is a subtle amplitude asymmetry, lower amplitude on the right compared to the left.  There are subtle, intermittent attenuations.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in richer, faster theta frequency activity.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Asymmetry with lower amplitude activity on the right.
Intermittent discontinuity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings should be taken into appropriate clinical context given the exposure to sedative hypnotic medications.  This EEG demonstrates reactivity to external stimuli, which is a positive prognostic factor.
