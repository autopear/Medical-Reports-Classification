CLINICAL HISTORY:   62 year-old gentleman with epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, renal failure and multiple medical problems now admitted with three days of shaking, the left arm more than the right, with facial twitching, dysarthria, gait instability.   He typically has monthly tonic clonic seizures but has not had any in May or June.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Corag, Plavix, Azor, Tekurna, Advair, lmdur, Statin, Nexium, Actos, Mentax, Excelon, Ranexa, Catapres
INTRODUCTION:  Digital  EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   The background EEG demonstrates intermittently, diffusely slow pattern.  There is intermittent, paroxysmal slowing.  When the patient is maximally awake, there is an alpha rhythm 9 Hz.  There are bursts of generalized  hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing as well as shifting slowing. Some of the rhythmic delta is more prominent from the left central region with a bit more arrhythmic delta from the right. Photic stimulation does not
activate the record. There is no mention of the patient experiencing  the motor activity during the
EEG and there is no accompanying  video.
	HR: 	84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Intermittent, generalized  background  slowing with paroxysmal slowing.
	2.	Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
	3. 	Interhemispheric asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic delta from the left and arrhythmic delta from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  It does not appear that the patient had any of his behaviors during this EEG.  No epileptiform features were seen in this markedly abnormal background.  Overall the appearance is one of a metabolic encephalopathy  particularly withburst of paroxysmal slowing.
