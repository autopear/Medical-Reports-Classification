CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 59-year-old male with renal failure, epilepsy, legally blind, diabetes, cardiomyopathy - awaiting renal transplant.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Dilantin, Tegretol, Solumedrol, others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient who is primarily drowsy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage without a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is prominent theta activity and there is some shifting asymmetries from the central region.  Later stage I sleep is characterized by rhythmic central slowing, which includes delta activity and occasional vertex waves. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Shifting asymmetries identified in drowsiness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: An individual of this age is permitted a low voltage pattern and the absence of a posterior dominant rhythm is not specifically abnormal.  The shifting theta and delta in drowsiness is non-specific, but would support an underlying disturbance of white matter from either hemisphere.  Correlation with imaging may be useful. No epileptiform features were seen.
