CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old male with post-traumatic epilepsy with increasing improvement in seizure control.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  There is no mention of a previous craniotomy defect. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 25 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with some temporal wicket.  In stage I sleep, vertex waves and POSTS are seen.  
Subtle abnormalities are seen in hyperventilation with an increase in amplitude, particularly from the left temporal region and occasion focal slowing seen in the temporal regions, left greater than right.  
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Subtle focal features from the left temporal region in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports an underlying structural or functional process on the left.  No epileptiform features were seen.
