MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Full stimulation, hyperventilation not performed. This is a 1 hour study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG shows an attenuation of periodic triphasics seen about every second bilaterally. Triphasic is irregular. A little more muscle affect is seen in the right hemisphere. Occasionally there is some variability seen on the epoch when the patient is seen gasping on the video. At these times she seemed to have some areas of theta frequency bilaterally.
	HR: 	100 bpm
IMPR  ESSION:  Markedly normal EEG due to:
	1. 	Continuation of regular triphasic wave seen bilaterally.
	2. 	No seizure activity is seen on this record.
	3. 		Discontinuation of the periodic triphasic waves which goes along with the toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  This is a technically inadequate study due to no documented stimulation by the technician during the study. Stimulation
would like to be seen in the patient with  this amount of encephalopathy.
