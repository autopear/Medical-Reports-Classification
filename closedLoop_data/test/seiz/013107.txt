CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old woman with change in mental status, shortness of 
breath taken to the emergency room, intubated and then extubated. Evaluate for 
encephalopathy. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ASA, Lovenox, Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite somnolent 
and wearing a face mask. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The majority of the record includes stage II sleep 
with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and POSTS. The patient transitions in and 
out of stage 2 sleep with K complexes, spindles and POSTS. There is head rocking 
artifact, but the POSTS are a little higher amplitude on the right compared to the left. 
Brief arousal produces an 8.5 hertz alpha rhythm and then the patient drifts off into 
sleep. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits, primarily in stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Clinical evaluation may be helpful to determine the cause 
for this patient's excessive drowsiness.
