CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old nursing home resident with a previous history of stroke, chronic left hemiparesis, previous history of subdural with an episode of unresponsiveness and a single seizure characterized by unilateral shaking of one side of the body on the 17th.  The patient is now extubated.  
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital and Dilantin.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake, moving about, but poorly interactive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Significant parts of the background of the EEG are obscured by muscle and movement artifact, however, the background is slow with shifting arrhythmic delta activity which at times is much more prominent on the left compared to the right.  The prominent frequencies in the background are a mixture of theta and delta.  At times the focal slowing from the left is sharply contoured with broadly contoured T1/T3 sharp waves.  Later portions of the record demonstrate more rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere compared to the left.  The left hemisphere remains richer in faster frequency activity.  
HR:  126 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
Shifting asymmetries with some portions of the record demonstrating more sharply contoured delta activity from the left temporal region, and others more rhythmic, slower activity from the left, and finally a third pattern with an intrahemispheric asymmetry with more disruption of faster frequency activity from the right compared to the left.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with bihemispheric pathology, the unique features seen from each hemisphere are representations of that specific pathology.  No seizures were recorded.
