CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 85-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease with first ever seizure characterized by the patient attempting to get up, eyes rolled back in the head, generalized shaking, vomiting, incontinence, and foaming at the mouth.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, aspirin, and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, diffusely slow with primarily a pattern of rhythmic 5 to 7 Hz theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is shifting arrhythmic delta, somewhat more prominent from the right hemisphere than the left. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing, right greater than left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  The features described above are non-specific, but are typical of those seen in Alzheimer’s disease.
