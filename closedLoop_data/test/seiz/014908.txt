CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 57-year-old, right-handed woman with ACA aneurysm repair with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse and markedly impaired memory.   
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and antihypertensives. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are portions of the record with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness, there is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity seen from the left anteriotemporal region with occasional bursts of delta from the right anteriotemporal region.  Features of drowsiness include generalized background slowing.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an amplitude asymmetry with a decrease in the amplitude seen initially on the right compared to the left.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for photoelectric artifact.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional left anteriotemporal delta in wakefulness.
Rare, right temporal delta. 
Rare amplitude asymmetries as the patient emerges to and from sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a previous study, this EEG shows a much more awake pattern.  The left anteriotemporal delta is more prominent, but this is a record that captures much more in wakefulness and is a better quality EEG.
