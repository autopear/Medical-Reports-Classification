CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old elderly gentleman with seizures, previous stroke, admitted after falling from a wheelchair with one-minute loss of consciousness, two minutes of confusion, and right-sided injury.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Dilantin, Heparin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record without hyperventilation or photic stimulation. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of this record demonstrates drowsiness with a disorganized record.  The posterior dominant rhythm is discernable bilaterally with 7 to 8 Hz, 20 to 30 V shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  As the patient becomes, drowsy, there is additional shifting arrhythmic delta activity, but no significant lateralization.  The overall record in drowsiness is relatively low voltage.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity particularly from the frontocentral regions, but without significant lateralization.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Correlation with imaging may be of use regarding the localization of this patientâ€™s problems. While there is no epileptiform activity in this record, if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing would be of use.
