CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old woman with epilepsy, depression, alcohol abuse, and schizophrenia. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Cogentin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 60 uV with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  While there is some head rocking artifact, there appears to be some subtle focal slowing from the right posterior temporal region, and in drowsiness there is some irregular bursts of slowing in the temporal regions bilaterally.  Rare, discrete T4 sharp waves are identified, some with spread to F8.  These can be identified at the close of hyperventilation and in light sleep.  Other features of hyperventilation include occasional, somewhat irregular slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for muscle artifact and minimal driving. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing from the right posterior temporal region, which is independent of the head rocking artifact.
Rare right mid-temporal sharp waves, which differ from the patient’s other sharply contoured background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for this patient’s seizures.  Consideration for a process involving the temporal region, right greater than left, would be appropriate.
