CLINICAL HISTORY:  88 year old woman status post head trauma and fall and subdural hematoma, now with seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan, Coumadin,  Levothyroxine, Hydrochlorothiazide.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This was an 24 hour study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As this record begins continuation of the interhemispheric asymmetry is seen with again a right low-voltage suppressed background.  As the record continues faster activity is seen in the right hemisphere in the theta range.  On the left hemisphere again sharp waves are seen in the P3/F3 distribution. Sometimes poly spike activity is seen at F3.  In between this activity, the record attenuate. There is no evolution of the spike and slow waves seen in the left hemisphere.
	HR:	78 bpm and irregular.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This record continues to show a focus of epilepsy in the left frontoparietal regions, but no continuation of non-convulsive status epilepticus is seen.  The right low voltage pattern questions a structural lesion. Further clinical correlation is recommended.
