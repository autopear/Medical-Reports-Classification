CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 24-year-old male with post-anoxic encephalopathy status-post gun shot wound with C1 fracture who coded twice, last time 12 hours prior to this EEG. Patient developed myoclonus over the last couple of hours. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Valium, Ativan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is unresponsive.  Noxious and tactile stimulation were performed.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized with a bihemispheric, periodic pattern of monomorphic PLEDS, PLEDS plus, and periods of suppression of the record. The amount of suppression is variable and more continuous at times.  There are occasional sharp waves identified, maximum at P4 and C4, and variable amounts of theta and delta rhythms identified.  Stimulation of the patient does not significantly alter the record.  The myoclonus does not always correlate with the epileptiform discharges.  
HR:  132 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral PLEDS and PLEDS plus.
Intermittent suppression of the record. 
Occasional sharp waves from the right hemisphere and occasional intermittent slowing in the delta and theta range.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is consistent with an acute disturbance of cerebral function and is consistent with the patient’s history of preceding anoxic injury.  The lack of variability in the records poses a guarded prognosis in the setting of this patient’s anoxic encephalopathy.  Other superimposed background changes can be explained by sedative hypnotic medications such as benzodiazepines.  No seizures were recorded.
