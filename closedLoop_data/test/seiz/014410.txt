CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old with renal failure and continuous seizures, 
characterized by continuous head twitching. Left intracerebral hemorrhage. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Zosyn, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a continuous 
pattern which is beta and delta frequency activity: Initially there is some isolated twitch 
artifact and then later, there is movement artifact, but no epileptiform discharges are 
seen in association with the movement and the characteristics of the movement initially 
are not typical for seizures. There is some head bobbing and sharply contoured 
· 
patterns. There is some suspicious underlying periodic activity in 'the left hemisphere 
which as the recording continues and the patient receives phenytoin is more clearly 
defined. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
2. Activity is slower on the left·, but not seen consistently. 
3. Question sharp waves on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the history described above, the EEG pattern is 
really more of a generalized than a focal pattern. There is only a small section with 
brief, periodic sharp waves. In addition, recordings for amelioration of the patient's 
artifacts or recording with elimination of the muscle artifact would provide a better· 
picture if clinically appropriate.
