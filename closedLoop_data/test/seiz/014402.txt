CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old man with AVM, CVA and embolization of AVM. 
Patient admitted after a fall.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tylen4Morphine, Famotidine, Lopressor, Vasotec, Zofran 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD The overall background during this recording 
shows generalized slowing mostly in the theta range, sometimes reaching 7 Hz but 
sometimes delta activity is also seen. At times there is attenuation of the background. 
There is also FIRDA. A posterior dominant rhythm is not seen on the record. 
Occasionally in the record there are some central triphasic waves seen rarely right 
greater than left. There is also a lot of EKG artifact seen on this recording. During the 
record the patient transitions into stage 1 sleep and vertex waves are seen. 
HR: 72 bpm  
Moderately abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slowing of the background with periods of attenuation. 
2. Rare triphasic waves seen In the central region right greater than left. 
3. FIRDA.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform discharges or seizures seen on 
this recording. The overall slowing of the background and triphasic waves are 
consistent with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.
