CLINICAL HISTORY: Adult male with'3 history of schizophrenia, diabetes, alcohol abuse and 
hepatitis B, found after a prolonged seizure. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are 
performed. The patient is intubated but is biting on the endotracheal tube. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The bad<ground EEG includes a low voltage pattern, with 
an intermittently discontinuous pattern. Cerebral activity occurs in more subtle lower voltage 
bursts of mixed theta and delta. There is a high amplitude left frontotemporal spike noted with 
the activity. Arousal produces muscle and then there are prominent frontal sharp waves. At 
9:33:44 a burst of sharp waves are identified from the right hemisphere. This burst is 14 
seconds in duration, reviewing the video it does not appear to be identified with clinical changes. 
Additional bursts are noted at 9:37 but again without definitive clinical correlate. Stimulation of 
the patient produces muscle but no definitive seizures. Additional bursts approximately 10 
seconds in duration are noted from the right hemisphere. 
HR: 126 bpm 
Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly abnormal background. 
2. Bursts and trains of sharp waves from the right anterior temporal region. 
3. Left anterior temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL This EEG supports a highly irritative focus. No clinical seizures 
were noted but given the irritability of the record ongoing vigilance is advised.
