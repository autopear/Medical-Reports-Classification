CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 63-year-old woman with a history of delusions, unsteady gait, stroke, seizures, and hypertension.  Patient had a seizure in the ER and was admitted. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somewhat drowsy throughout the record.  When she is maximally awake, there is a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with some shifting arrhythmic delta. Intermittent bursts of frontal delta are seen as she drifts off to sleep. 
Left anterior temporal sharp waves are identified in wakefulness, becomes more clearly defined in stage I sleep.  There is some subtle focal slowing in the left hemisphere when the patient becomes drowsy.  
HR:  78 BPM, with high complex QAS. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left mid-temporal sharp waves.
Generalized background slowing.
Subtle focal slowing from the left in sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  The background slowing is non-specific and may be due to a postictal state or previous strokes.
