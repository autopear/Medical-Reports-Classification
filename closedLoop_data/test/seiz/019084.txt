CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old woman with new onset seizures.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and well organized for age.  There is a 10.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm, which is well attenuated with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation mildly increased the slow activity of theta waves in the background, but no epileptiform discharges were seen.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient fell asleep, which is evidenced by a mixed frequency of vertex waves and spindles. 
Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving. 
HR:  110 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and light sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG in the lab may be helpful.
