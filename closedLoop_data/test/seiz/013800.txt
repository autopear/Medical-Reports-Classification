	CLINICAL HISTORY:	47 year-old  with epilepsy  after starting  dialysis. Seizures are described as staring  and stiffness. History  of depression and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Percocet, Celexa,  Renagel, Norvasc, Catapres, Levsin, Senipar, Reglan, Prilosec, Zocor
INTRODUCTION:  Digital  video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   Hyperventilation is attempted and photo stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE R ECORD:  In maximal apparent wakefulness, there is a 7
hertz posterior dominant rhythm. The overall background is somewhat slow with a scant amount  of delta observed in the posterior regions  bilaterally. In the transition to drowsiness versus FIRDA  are observed. Scant photic  driving is noted.
	HR: 	72 bpm.
IMPR  ESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Generalized background slowing.
	2. 	Posteriorly predominant occasional delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features  are observed in this record. The features  described above  are nonspecific and can be seen in diffuse  disturbance, cerebral  function. If characterization in this individuals epilepsy  is important, a repeat tracing capturing deeper  states of sleep could be performed for comparison of previous studies may be helpful.
