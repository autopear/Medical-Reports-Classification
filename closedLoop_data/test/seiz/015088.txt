CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 78-year-old woman with dementia, syncope, dizziness, with an episode of unresponsiveness. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in maximal wakefulness.  There is intermittent focal slowing characterized by rhythmic or arrhythmic delta from the left frontotemporal region and the overall background in both hemispheres includes 4 to 6 Hz theta.  In wakefulness into stage II sleep, there are high amplitude, left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave complexes.  In addition, the delta from the left is higher amplitude than the remainder of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with vertex waves seen in stage I sleep.
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing from the left temporal region.
High amplitude, left frontotemporal spike and slow wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  Consideration for a structural or functional abnormality is appropriate.  Given the amplitudes described above, consideration for a craniotomy is recommended.
