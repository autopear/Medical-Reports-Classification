CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year-old gentleman with right arm weakness followed by 
right arm shaking for several minutes. After this, he felt sleepy. When his woke, his 
right arm was weaker than previously. CT demonstrated left parietal mass with edema. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, others. No medication list available. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. 
This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is drowsy with 
primarily a mixed theta and delta frequency background. Superimposed upon this, 
there are several areas of focal slowing with some subtle sharp activity in the right 
central region. As the patient arouses, the activity is more symmetric. There is, 
however, some shifting slowing in right or left central areas. Features of sleep include: 
Vertex waves followed by arousal. Towards the close of the record, photic stimulation is 
performed. The patient is drifting off to sleep but brief, scant driving responses are 
observed. 
HR: 80 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Very mild abnormal EEG due to: 
1. shifting slowing in the central regions, somewhat sharply contoured on the right. 
CLINICAL These findings carry an intermediate correlation with a 
structural or functional abnormality in the central regions. Additional evaluation may be 
warranted given the fact that some of the features described above are bilateral, but 
given the CAT scan described above, features described were less prominent than one 
would expect.
