CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old woman with dementia, central retinal artery occlusion, cerebellar atrophy, previously on Dilantin and Phenobarbital.  History of seizures characterized by some sort of complex partial activity, which the patient canâ€™t really describe.  The patient is not aware of the frequency of her seizures; unreliable historian.
MEDICATIONS: Ecotrin, Depakote, and Reminyl.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 8.5 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness and in increasing drowsiness, there is intermittent focal slowing from the left temporal region with primarily rhythmic, 3 to 4 Hz activity.  Associated with this, despite some eye movement artifact, there is both sharply contoured delta activity and sharp waves. There are also occasional bursts of shifting, arrhythmic delta activity. 
Photic stimulation elicits driving at intermediate and faster flash frequencies. 
HR:  48 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Rhythmic focal slowing from the left temporal region.
Occasional, sharply contoured left temporal delta or sharp waves.
Occasional right temporal focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The bitemporal features may be related to either the onset of epilepsy early in life or the bilateral, subcortical white matter changes.
