CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 56-year-old male with new onset seizures for which the patient is amnestic.  History of hypertension, TB, and gout.
MEDICATIONS: Dilaudid, Dilantin, and Percocet.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 7 to 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in a background with excess theta.  The overall background is somewhat disorganized.  The patient seems to be excessively drowsy, drifting off into stage I sleep.  Occasional bursts of frontally predominant delta are identified in wakefulness/early drowsiness.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific.  With the FIRDA, consideration for a toxic or metabolic process as well as postictal state is appropriate.  No 
epileptiform features were seen, therefore, a follow-up study may be helpful.
