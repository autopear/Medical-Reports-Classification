CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 84-year-old woman with hypertension, ambulatory dysfunction, dementia, and seizures. Patient was found to be progressively less responsive.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Aricept, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric, continuous, and fairly well organized for age.  However, there is a small amount of mildly increased slow activity of low amplitude superimposed on the background.  There is an 8 Hz, 25 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is attenuated with eyes opened. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Sleep is not achieved in this tracing.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	Slight background slowing.
	Slightly slow alpha rhythm for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The mildly slow background with slow alpha activity is a non-specific finding and can be seen in patients with encephalopathy due to metabolic, infectious, dementia, postictal phase, or medication effect.  Clinical correlation is recommended. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
