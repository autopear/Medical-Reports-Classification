CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 42-year-old male with HIV infection, non-compliant, polysubstance abuse, and G6PD deficiency admitted with a breakthrough seizure and a fall.  History of head trauma when struck by a train and multiple stab wounds.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  There is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is 20 to 40 V, sometimes higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.   In drowsiness, there is an increase in background theta which appears earlier on the left.  There is also a small amount of underlying delta.  Other features of stage I sleep include POSTS.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and frontal delta are identified in stage II sleep.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing a small amount of bilateral theta.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral delta.  
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing primarily in sleep with underlying left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While there is some wicket activity identified from the left temporal region, in the setting of underlying breach, there is no definite epileptiform activity and the sharply contoured activity on the left may be related to skull thickness.  This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left.  If a further characterization of this patientâ€™s epileptiform activity is needed, a repeat study with deeper stages of sleep may be of use.
