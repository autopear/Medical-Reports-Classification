CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 20-year-old woman with complex epilepsy, complicated labor and delivery, MVA as a child, seizures characterized by frontal headache followed by a feeling as if she is floating, which may be associated with visual phenomenon including circular visual phenomenon and then tonic-clonic activity with incontinence and tongue biting.  Patient was struck in the back of the head with a pistol yesterday and subsequently had a seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a symmetric, reactive 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In apparent wakefulness, hyperventilation, and early drowsiness, there is subtle, left temporal focal slowing.  There is a single left temporal sharp wave identified early in hyperventilation.  Vertex waves are seen in brief stage I sleep, but stage I sleep is not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric, bilateral driving.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In that only a single sharp wave was identified, additional EEG recording may be useful to clearly define this patientâ€™s epileptiform activity.  Alternatively, comparison with her childhood EEGs may be of use. This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left.
