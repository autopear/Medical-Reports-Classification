	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	Unknown male who presented to the emergency room in status epilepticus with a temp of 102.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: using standard channel of EKG. intubated.
Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in
10/20 system of electrode placement with one
The patient is in a hard collar and is
ICU
					DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern, routine beta frequency activity as well as small amounts of theta and delta. 	Eye rolling movement artifacts are observed. 	At times the background is almost discontinuous. 	Stimulation of the patient does not clearly produce a change in the background. 	Movement artifact is observed with stimulation.
HR: 90 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with primarily a mixed frequency beta pattern.
2. Marked background slowing.
3. At times almost a discontinuous pattern.
			CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	No seizures were observed. 	No epileptiform features were observed. 	This record should be placed in the appropriate clinical context given the use of medications for status epilepticus.
Long Term Monitoring - 07-77 08/05/2007
		INTRODUCTION: 	Continuous video EEG recording is performed at bedside in ICU using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 	There are no clinical notes indicating that additional medications are given nor that any additional seizures occurred.
			DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD: 	The background EEG is relatively continuous, rich in beta frequency activity with small amounts of theta. 	As the recording continues, the patient remains intubated, initially relatively motionless. 	Over time, particularly by 6 a.m. there is an emergence of some muscle artifact. 	There is also the emergence of theta frequency activity. 	 Frontal theta is observed bilaterally.
HR: 66 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	This continuous video EEG monitoring session is remarkable for:
1.  No epileptiform features.
2. No seizures.
3. Initially a very sedated pattern, improving to a pattern rich in beta frequency activity with some eye movements suggesting an improvement or a decrease in the degree of sedation.
