	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	44 year old male who was assaulted, has a subdural hematoma and chronic edema, renal failure.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Heparin,  Famotidine,  Aranesp
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is intubated and in a hard collar. He has facial edema.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern of rhythmic theta followed by intermittent attenuation with slower delta.  The activity is quite rhythmic and relatively symmetric, although at times it seems to be a little less on the right. At times there is an underlying vertex wave in the record. Tactile stimulation of the patient seems to produce an increase in faster frequency activity. It also produces more of the rhythmic theta and less of the delta or attenuation.
	HR:	126 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Replacement of normal background with rhythmic theta pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This diffusely slow pattern is more typical of that seen in medication overdose or ESRD than an acute trauma pattern.  This patient's metabolic disturbances may play a role in the pattern described above.  No epileptiform features were seen.   The very minimal focal features described above may be correlated with imaging.
