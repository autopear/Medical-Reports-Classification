CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year-old with a gunshot wound to neck involving carotid 
artery, injury to subclavian, C3, C4, found unconscious. Now quadriplegic with 
myoclonus and eye movements. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, EPI, Insulin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is comatose and intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly suppressed with 
intermittent bursts of higher amplitude faster frequency activity seen every 1 0 to 20 
seconds. These bursts of activity may be every 3 to 5 seconds in duration. With this 
very suppressed background, the bursts of activity that are present are higher 
amplitude, primarily theta frequency activity with some faster frequency activity. The 
bursts of activity include activity ranging from 50 to 200 microvolts. At times the longest 
duration of suppression for this record is 40 seconds. Tactile stimulation of the patient 
does activate the record. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Burst suppression pattern with most periods of suppression in the category to 20 
to 30 seconds but some as long as 40 seconds. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy. 
In the absence of sedative hypnotic medications, given the history described above, 
these findings suggest one of the most severe patterns of brain injury.
