	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	Seventy-three-year-old male with dementia, past frostbite, cachexia, epilepsy and syncope. Previous left craniotomy.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, others.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard
10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
	DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, there is a fair degree of muscle and movement artifact. There is a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm identified in wakefulness but there is also excess theta. The patient seems to be quite drowsy and as he drifts off to sleep a high amplitude spike and wave complex is identified from the left hemisphere with a generous field of spread including left central parietal and right mid to anterior temporal. Reviewing the spike with an average reference, it is nearly isoelectric at P3, T3 and less to
at PS. It clearly has an extensive field on the left anterior temporal
region as well as the parietal region. The epileptiform activity is quite prominent as the patient drifts off to sleep. In addition, there are as a handful of sharp waves which have a field involving the
right. Some of these are right centrotemporal and are not the rightÂ­ sided equivalent of the left-sided discharge. In the sleep recording there are also left centrotemporal rather than the parietal spikes. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response on the left. HR:
66-80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Epileptiform activity from either hemisphere with variable maxima.
These include left parietal, left centrotemporal and occasional right frontotemporal or right posterior temporal.
	2. 	Excess background theta.
	3.	Superimposed focal slowing from the left.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a process involving both hemispheres. Consideration for a localization-related mechanism for
		epilepsy is appropriate.
