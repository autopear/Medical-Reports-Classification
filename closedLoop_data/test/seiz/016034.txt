CLINICAL HISTORY: This  is a  42-year-old  woman  with  Down 's  syndrome  and
Alzheimer's disease, childhood epilepsy, transferred for crescendo seizures. MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Phenytoin , Phenobarbital, Versed, Dilantin, and Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background EEG is continuous.   V./hen the patient is not stimulated, the background is slow with delta and bursts  of theta activity. When the patient arouses spontaneously, there is a theta pattern and the suggestion of a 9
Hz poste1ior dominant rhytbm. Towards the close of the record, as the patient d1ifts off to
sleep, there is prominent frontal fast activity, which is both alpha and beta frequency.
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Excess beta.
2.   Slow, disorganized pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with crescendo seizures, there are no focal or epileptiform features.  A repeat tracing may be of use.
