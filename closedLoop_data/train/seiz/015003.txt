CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 69-year-old, right-handed male with a previous subarachnoid hemorrhage and a “sudden convulsion two weeks ago (?)”.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  There is no mention of a craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is excess background theta and a certain degree of superimposed disorganization.  In addition, there is arrhythmic delta activity from the left hemisphere, typically picked up in the left frontotemporal region but sometimes in the left posteriotemporal region.  There are a handful of left frontotemporal sharp waves.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.
HR:  96 BPM, with occasional PVCs.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Arrhythmic delta from the left hemisphere, typically in the left frontotemporal region, but occasionally posteriorly. 
Intermittent background slowing and disorganization.
Occasional left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests a structural or functional abnormality, which  may involve the left hemisphere more significantly than the right.  Given the amplitude of the delta from the left, consideration for either an underlying structural abnormality and/or a previous craniotomy is important, although none is mentioned.
