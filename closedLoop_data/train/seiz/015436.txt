CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a __-year-old, right-handed Indian farmer who immigrated to the US with a history of epilepsy for the last three years.  No known epilepsy risk factors identified.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 12 Hz, 50 uV alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The major abnormality in this recorded is identified in wakefulness and includes a right anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complex, which is high amplitude, reaching amplitudes of 150 uV and is associated with disruption of faster frequency activity in that region. The intermittent focal slowing with rhythmic theta and delta is seen in wakefulness.  The focal slowing may be accentuated by drowsiness, but the spike activity seems to be the same in wakefulness and drowsiness.  There is some volume conduction with some spread of the spike to the left frontal region. 
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. 
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Right anteriotemporal spike and slow wave activity with associated focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were discussed with the family who and the patient is scheduled for neuroimaging.
