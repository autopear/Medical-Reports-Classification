CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old bald woman .h schizophrenia and hepat.is C admitted with Dilantin toxicity. The patient is unable to describe her seizures. but has been seizure free for the last 3 years. History of perhaps tonic-clonic seizures. hypertension and hyperlipidemia. 
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox. Nexium, Morphine, Trazodone, Lexapro.
 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1o-20 system electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is no hyperventilation nor photic stimulation Performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG Is slow and disorganized with a theta frequency posterior dominant rhythm and basically 4-5 Hz overall background. There is shifting arrhythmic delta activity particularly in the posterior temporal regions and at times there is 
prominent disruption of faster frequency either on the right or the left In this sharply oontoured record, there is a suggestion of a posterior sharp wave but review· with the circle montage fails 
to identify this. In the transition to and from sleep, there are asymmetric, shifting vertex waves and a single left centrotemporal sharp wave and another T3 sharp wave. 
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization. 
2. Prominent, shifting arrhythmic de..a activity. 
3. Epileptiform activity In the left centrotemporal region.
 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging. This patient’s metabolic abnormalities may accentuate the background slowing and disorganization. A localization-related epilepsy should be considered.
