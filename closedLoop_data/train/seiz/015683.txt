CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 22-year-old male with epilepsy onset 2001 with loss of consciousness and confusion.  Last seizure 11/11/06.  Patient is known to have a right temporal shunt and difficulty communicating.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Motrin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 30 uV, which is symmetric and reactive.  There is an apparent breach rhythm in the right frontocentral region with increase of the amplitude of new activity in that region.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit of an underlying asymmetry with a suggestion and attenuation of faster frequency activity in the frontocentral region.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Hyperventilation produces some bilateral rhythmic slowing and subtly accentuates the intrahemispheric asymmetry.  
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Subtle asymmetry with some subtle slowing from the right frontocentral region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding post-craniotomy.  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, additional recording capturing sleep may be valuable.
