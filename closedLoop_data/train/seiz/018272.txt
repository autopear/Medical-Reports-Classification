CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 39-year-old female, former crack addict with a history of seizure disorder consisting of general tonic-clonic seizures with tongue biting, urinary incontinence, and loss of consciousness; last seizure was three months ago. She also has Crohnâ€™s disease and recent cholostomy, psychiatric problems, depression, aggressive behavior, and loss of memory.  She stopped using four years ago.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, see tech sheet, and others including psychiatric medications (unknown).  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. No previous EEGs were available for comparison. This is an awake and slightly sleepy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an 8.5 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm which is  intermittently disrupted on the right.  Frequent T6, sharply contoured slow waves were identified. Hyperventilation increased this focal slowing activity.  
Photic stimulation did not activate the record. 
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent disruption of alpha rhythm in the right hemisphere. 
Right posterior temporal parietal region focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing and asymmetric alpha suggest structural lesion. To further delineate epileptiform activity a repeat EEG or sleep deprived EEG is recommended.
