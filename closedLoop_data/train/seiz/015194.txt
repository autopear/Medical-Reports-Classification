CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old male with epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol, Dilantin, and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous, symmetric, and fairly well organized for age.  There is a 10 Hz, 25 V posterior dominant rhythm, which attenuates with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient became drowsy, which is evidenced by increased beta activity as well as theta activity.  A few vertex waves are also seen. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved. 
Photic stimulation elicits driving.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep or sleep deprivation prior to the EEG may be helpful.
