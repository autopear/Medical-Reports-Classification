CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year-old right-handed woman with epilepsy since May of 2007 after a 
fall with head trauma. The patient was ill and required rehabilitation. She was not taking 
seizure medicines and in the context of a UTI, had a seizure in January. Irregular heart rate 
with a pacemaker. 
MEDICATIONS: Synthroild, Dilantin, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an 
awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is mildly slow for age 
with an 8-8.5 Hz alpha rhythm of 30 microvolts. There are occasional bursts of shifting irregular 
delta. In addition, although there is some lateral rectus artifact, there are occasional sharp 
waves identified independently from the right or left temporal region. Those on the right are mid 
to posterior temporal and the left mid temporal. Features of drowsiness included increase in 
background sign, photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: 
1. 
Shifting irregular temporal delta activity. 
2. 
Independent sharp waves identified from either temporal region. Those on the right are 
mid to posterior temporal. Those on the left are more mid temporal and can be 
differentiated from the lateral rectus spikes. 
Occasional bursts of FIRDA. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features support a localization related mechanism for 
epilepsy. Comparison with imaging and/or history of previous craniotomy is recommended.
