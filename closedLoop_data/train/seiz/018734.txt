CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male with a history of an AVM repair many years ago with development of a subdural hematoma October 2004.  
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Dilantin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The major feature in this record is a breach rhythm from the left hemisphere maximum in the left frontocentral and parietal regions.  The activity emanating from this area is characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity, arrhythmic delta, and sharply contoured activity with occasional sharp waves at C3 and rarely at P3.   The focal slowing as well as the beta activity from this region is accentuated by drowsiness.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves.  A MU rhythm is identified and is higher amplitude from the left. Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent focal slowing from the left frontocentral region.
Sharp waves from the left central and parietal regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are congruent with this patientâ€™s previous neurosurgery.  The epileptiform activity supports a partial or localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
