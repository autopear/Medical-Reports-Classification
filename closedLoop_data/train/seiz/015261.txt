CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 76-year-old male with a 20-year history of epilepsy described as shaking of the arms and mouth with tremulousness lasting three to five minutes.  The patient has postictal amnesia for events – last episode occurred two months ago.  The patient has difficulty giving a history, but is aware that there is a history of dementia and hypertension.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, aspirin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity identified from either hemisphere.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is some frontally predominant rhythmic delta.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.   
HR:  50 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Arrhythmic delta activity identified from either hemisphere
	Excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG supports a process involving either hemisphere.  Comparison with previous EEGs may be helpful in terms of characterizing this patient’s epileptiform activity.
