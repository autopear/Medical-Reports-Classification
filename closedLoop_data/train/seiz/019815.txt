CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 79-year-old male status-post craniotomy for subdural hematoma, persistently drowsy.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, insulin, and Vancomycin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent throughout, but does respond to tactile stimulation.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, relatively slow with a mixture of lower voltage, 3 to 5 Hz activity.  A craniotomy can be identified from the right with sharply contoured activity and an increase in amplitude.  Despite the breach and accentuation of faster frequency activity in that region, there is a T2 sharp and slow wave complex identified with generous field of spread throughout the right hemisphere.  This demonstrates clear periodicity and it does not evolve into a seizure. Stimulation of the patient produces some clinical evidence of responsiveness, but does not significantly change the EEG. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, somewhat featureless slow pattern.
Periodic right temporal sharp waves. 
Breach activity with focal slowing in the right temporal region.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized background slowing and relatively low voltage pattern supports an underlying encephalopathy.  The periodic sharp waves support a partial mechanism for seizures.  If subtle seizures are a consideration, an additional EEG recording may be valuable.
