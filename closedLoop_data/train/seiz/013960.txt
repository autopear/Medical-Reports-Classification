CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 40-year-old male who presents with HIV, PRES NEH with four day headache and seizures, intubated with the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis and mass effect in midline shift.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Mannitol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is primarily an asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somnolent or asleep throughout much of the record.  Stimulation of the patient elicits only a brief alerting.  The vast majority of the record is drowsiness or stage II sleep, at which time the background is diffuse beta with asymmetry, more beta identified from the left than the right, and at times better defined spindles or vertex waves from the left than the right.  In addition, there is slower delta activity identified on the right compared to the left, particularly the right posterior quadrant. Stimulation of the patient elicits a fleeting arousal with alpha and beta frequency activity from the left, a suggestion of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, and a right hemisphere demonstrating significantly more delta, again particularly in the posterior quadrant and prominent disruption of faster frequency activity from the right.  Immediately after this, the patient drifts off to sleep.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal delta from the right hemisphere, particularly the right posterior regions with some involvement in the left.
Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right, which affects both gray and white matter.  There were no epileptiform features seen.
