CLINICAL HISTORY: 53-year-old with change in mental status, left frontal 
hemorrhage, history of heavy alcohol abuse, alcohol withdrawal and seizures earlier in 
this prolonged hospitalization. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Zosyn, Vancomycin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, but 
responsive. Chewing and other artifacts are observed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is diffusely slow. It includes a 
mixed frequency pattern rich in theta, some beta, but also arrhythmic delta activity. The 
patient drifts in and out of sleep state alternating with restlessness and their intermittent 
bursts of beta followed by an arousal. Evidence of beta spindles are observed, but 
sleep is not sustained. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response 
with more of a theta-delta pattern. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Significant background slowing with a mixed frequency pattern. 
2. Prominent arrhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There may be an underlying disturbance of sleep or this 
may be a noisy environment and that the patient drops into stage II with beta spindles 
and then arouses and does fine.
