HISTORY:  39 yr old  female with bipolar disease, alcohol abuse, epilepsy and panic attack. Dilantin overdose.
MEDICATION: Dilantin, Seroquel, Prozac, many others.
ACTIVATION: Hyperventilation and Photic Stimulation.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital Video BEG was perfonned in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and <l:rowsy record.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background BEG includes symmetric reactive 9 Hz, 30-50uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Central MU rhythm is identified but testing is not performed to confirm this. There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.   Drowsiness is characterized by slow  rolling eye movement with an increase in background rhythmic theta.Â· Hyperventilation is perfonned with good effort producing rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:   70BPM
IMPR ESSION: Normal BEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  No focal n.or epileptiform features are identified in this record.  The generous beta is compatible with this patient 's medication.  A normal EEG does not  exclude a diagnosis of  epilepsy.   If further characterization of seizures 1s important, additionarecording may be valuable.
