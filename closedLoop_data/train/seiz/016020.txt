CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year-old woman status post heart transplant 1994, ileus, 
encephalitis, hypothyroidism, progressive decline in cognition, now with seizure since 
May 2008. Last seizure a month ago. 
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dilantin, Insulin, Famotidine, Metformin, Metoprolol, 
Valproic Acid, Keppra, Cellcept, Sirolimus, Synthroid, Lovenox, Lamotrigine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is 
an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a markedly 
abnormal EEG with a diffuse theta pattern. This pattern alternates with delta 
background. In this individual with a markedly slow background, stimulation of the 
patient produces an alerting response with a transition to more of a theta pattern. 
Photic stimulation elicits photoelectric artifact. Stimulation of the patient produces an 
increase in theta frequency background. 
HR: 108 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this record. The 
features described above are nonspecific, but can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of 
cerebral function. There were no definitive sharp waves observed today. In that the 
individual is reactive, the marked background slowing in a reactive individual is more 
compatible with a chronic encephalopathy.
