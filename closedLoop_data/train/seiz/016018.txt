CLINICAL IDSTORY: This is a 35-year-old, mentally retarded woman with epilepsy since age 12, last tonic-clonic seizure two years ago, but intermittent episodes of hypersomnolence.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lamictal, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is perfo1med in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is lacking a normal alpha rhythm,  although LAMBDA activity is seen.   The p1imary background frequency is theta with smaller amounts of delta.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of his age due to:
1.  Absence of some of the normal developmental milestones.
2.   Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG may be correlated with previous studies.  No epileptifom1 features were seen.
