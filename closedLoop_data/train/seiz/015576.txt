CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old male with new onset seizures x 2 with black outs, right and left arm and leg movements. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous and fairly well organized for age.  There is a 10 Hz, 25 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is attenuated with eyes opened. As the tracing continues, focal slowing of theta and delta waves is seen at C3, P3, and occasionally at F3 and T3.  Sleep is evidenced by a mixed frequency of brain activity, as well as a few spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits driving, but no abnormal responses.  
HR:  102 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Focal slowing of theta activity in the left central region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is suggestive of a localization-related mechanism for seizures or a structural lesion in this patient.  Correlation with neuroimaging studies may be helpful.
