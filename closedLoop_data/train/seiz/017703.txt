EVENTTIME 15:09:16: The EEG demonstrates the patient’s relatively typical normal awake pattern.  The patient is holding onto the push button and telling the nurse about difficulty moving her leg.  There is some background theta from the left temporal region, but no clear epileptiform change, and the overall description of the symptoms is not like her more severe or her more mild seizures.  
EVENT TIME 15:19:47: The patient has a seven second-burst of high amplitude spike and slow wave activity from the left hemisphere.  Four seconds later, bilateral alpha activity is seen.  During the event, she is somewhat motionless and pushes the button at 15:20:08.  By the time she pushes the button, she is able to speak.  Of note, she pushes the button for a discharge lasting 15 seconds in duration.  
EVENT TIME 16:21:05: The patient is in the room with a nurse.  The EEG demonstrates an awake pattern.  At 16:28, she pulls up some yarn.  By 16:28:53, there is some rhythmic theta developing out the left hemisphere. The nurses are talking and the patient continues to knit, but she is actually not able to talk.  She is fiddling with the yarn.  She pushes the button at 16:29:09.  Of note, she pushes the button but she can’t speak to the nurses.  The EEG activity continues to build up at 16:29:16 with rhythmic theta out of this.  The patient is no longer using her hands, and the yarn is still in her lap.  Although there is an alpha rhythm, there is clear build up of rhythmic temporal activity.  The patient is sitting motionless and the nurse observes the patient in this motionless state.  The seizure appears to be ending at 16:29:45 and at 16:29:48 she lifts her head up and is interactive again.  
EVENT TIME 17:13:34:  No clear EEG change is seen. 
EVENT TIME 18:16:32: Complex partial seizure at 18:15.  The patient is awake with materials on her tray.  Initially, there is the subtle onset of theta from the left hemisphere, which is discernable by 18:16:24.  At that time, there may even be a small amount on the right.  There is clear localization to the left temporal region by 18:16:44 with rhythmic theta and delta.  This is sharply contoured. This activity is over by 18:17:24.  
EVENT TIME 19:21:09: Actual seizure onset is 19:19:50.  The patient is lying in bed and appears to be drifting off to sleep, although there is an alpha rhythm identified.  Repetitive sharply contoured delta is picked up from the left hemisphere maximum at T1 at 19:20.  This demonstrates frequency evolution over the next 20 seconds.  There is an increase in fast activity, but an ongoing underlying left temporal theta over the next 20 seconds.  The patient’s mother is rubbing her back.  The mother doesn’t appear to be aware of the seizure.  The patient pushes the button essentially after the event is over, and the event seems to be ending at 19:21:00.  
EVENT TIME 19:42:  There is a lot of muscle, but no clear EEG change.  
EVENT TIME 21:25:  The patient is awake and talking to her mother.  At 21:24, there is a small increase in theta on the left.  This is relatively subtle, and this brief burst lacks the characteristic paroxysmal nature of the patient’s more typical seizures.  
EVENT TIME  - Difficult to determine: The patient is moving about and talking.  There is the appearance of theta picked up at 21:29:10, with a clear evolution of frequency at 21:29:40 with a mixture of theta and sharply contoured delta from the left temporal region.  The seizure appears to be over by 21:31.  
EVENT TIME 22:15: There is a subtle increase in theta from the left temporal region at 21:16:20.  This seizure lacks clear or strong EEG correlates. 
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: This section of the record demonstrates sleep, unlike the initial sections of the record.  In stage II sleep, there are spindles and POSTS.  There is some shifting asymmetries in sleep, but the overall background is relatively symmetric.  There is sustained stage II sleep in this record.  There are rare right temporal sharp waves.  In comparison to other portions of the record, there are also occasional left temporal sharp waves seen in sleep independently.  In comparison to the initial portions of the record, there is less in the way of the bursts of paroxysmal fast activity from the right temporal region. 
OVERALL IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to:
	Multiple complex partial seizures identified maximum in the left temporal region. 
	More than one pattern for this patient’s left temporal seizures, some of which have a more stronger EEG signature than others, but all with the same localization.
	Independent, left greater than right temporal spike and slow wave activity.
	Intermittent bursts of fast activity from the right temporal region.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term monitoring session is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy.
