CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of stroke, now ventilated and trached. He presents with new onset seizures which are focal or generalized with left gaze deviation and left jerking and a right hemiparesis.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Theophylline, Apogen, antibiotics, and anti-TB medicine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. The patient was unresponsive during the EEG recording and was described as postictal. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage with a mixed frequency background of theta and delta activity.  Excessive muscle artifact was intermixed.  Stimulation of the patient -----Was there variabilityâ€¦.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Low voltage tracing with a mixed frequency background of theta and delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The low voltage diffusely slow EEG can be seen postictal phase or diffuse disorder cerebral function including gray and white matter.  This is a non-specific pattern.  However, no focal or epileptiform activity was seen in this tracing.  In view of the muscle artifact, if epilepsy is a concern, a repeat EEG would be helpful.
