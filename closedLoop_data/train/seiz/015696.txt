CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 60-year-old woman with epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, daily angina who presented with a sudden frontal headache, shaking of the body, loss of consciousness, chest burning associated with a right basal ganglion hemorrhage.  History of incontinence and hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background is mildly slow with a posterior dominant rhythm averaging 7 Hz, 30 to 40 uV, and a small amount of diffuse background theta.  There is some shifting asymmetries noted in the record and in some portions of the record there seems to be a bit more, rhythmic theta frequency slowing from the right hemisphere in comparison to the left.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta, as well as generalized theta.   
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Generalized background slowing.
	Intermittent rhythmic slowing from the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The generalized background slowing is a non-specific finding and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function or postictal state.  The rhythmic background slowing from the right may be correlated with imaging.
