CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old woman with a left hemispheric stroke and subsequent seizures, which are typically tonic-clonic in nature.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Vasotec, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a significant amount of muscle activity that nearly obscures the EEG.  The tech has some difficulty communicating with the patient to get her to relax. Underlying the muscle is a pattern of primarily theta frequency activity with smaller amounts of beta.  There are periodic complexes identified from the left hemisphere.  On some occasions, these are difficult to delineate because of the artifact, but are clearly epileptiform in nature and in some cases are maximum in the left frontocentral region, but with some spread to the posterior temporal region.  On other occasions, they are maximum at T3 or T1 with a more clear-cut temporal morphology.  They are so high amplitude that they clearly disrupt the remainder of the background.  The muscle artifact persists as the patient becomes drowsy.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Technically challenging but abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Periodic complexes from the left hemisphere with variable maximum.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The muscle activity precludes further characterization of this EEG, but the epileptiform activity is so high amplitude that it can be identified despite the technical limitations described above.
