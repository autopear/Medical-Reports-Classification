CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old woman with a right craniotomy status-post resection of hemangioma 06/04.  History of seizures â€“ last seizure 05/06. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 to 60 uV.  The alpha rhythm has prominent spread into the frontal region, but is clearly reactive to eye opening. Drowsiness is characterized by generalized background slowing.  There are a few irregular, high amplitude frontally predominant proximal bursts of slowing in the transition to sleep.  Vertex waves are identified in stage I sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.   Hyperventilation elicits similar paroxysmal bursts at the end of HV. Of note, the vertex waves were maximum at the midline, but having a greater field on the left.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	1.	Frontally predominant, irregular paroxysmal bursts in early drowsiness.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a non-specific finding.  These bursts are more common in older adults.  No epileptiform features were seen, and there were no hallmarks of an underlying encephalopathy.
