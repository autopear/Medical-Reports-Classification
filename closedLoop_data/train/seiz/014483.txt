HISTORY: 74 year old woman with previous massive, right MCA CVA presented 
with The patient had a third seizure, received Ativan and became comatose. 
 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin , 
Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 of eletrode with 1-channel EKG. Seizure and spike detection is employed overnight 
for individual who suffered multiple seizures at 6 p.m. and became obtunded. Over the 
the recording, the patient gradually awakens. She voices complaints, although her 
is difficult to understand and Increasingly moves her right arm. 
DECRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Over the course of this long-term recording, this 9-hour 
long-term EEG recording, the background EEG starts out as a very slow, low-voltage pattern, 
markedly suppressed on the right and intermittently discontinuous on the right. This 
extraordinarily slow pattern remains relatively static at 2 a.m. and at 4 a.m. No seizures are 
There is intermittently this very gradual improvement in theta from the left. By 6:11 
a.m., patient is clearly awakening with an Increase in theta on the left. As she becomes 
awake, she is moving about producing muscle artifact, but low voltage theta Is 
observed. There is a suggestion of a phase reversal with some sharply contoured theta at T5-
T3. At the close of recording, left posterior temporal delta is observed in a low voltage pattern 
with relative suppression, but the burst suppression pattern has resolved. 
HR: 70 to 90 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION Abnormal EEG due to number 
1. Initially a marked suppressed, even discontinuous pattern. 
2. Improvement over time, particularly from the left hemisphere with the appearance of 
intermittent theta activity on the left and some sharply contoured posterior temporal 
slowing.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION This EEG supports an improvement from what was initially a very 
encephalopathy.
