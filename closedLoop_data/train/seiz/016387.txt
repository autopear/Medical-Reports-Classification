CLINICAL HISTORY: 63-year-old right-handed female admitted for fever, suffering a 
tonic-clonic seizure March 28, 2008. Patient's arms and legs are contracted. Patient is 
nonverbal with history of Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, 
depression, and a PEG tube. Currently with aspiration pneumonia. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Lovenox, Sinemet, Heparin, Metoprolol, 
Ativan, ASA 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EEG. The patient is awake. There is a 
significant amount of muscle artifact in the background. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Beneath the muscle artifact there is a posterior 
dominant rhythm averaging 6Hz, 40 mcv. There is a generous amount of low voltage, 
frontal central activity. Three portions of the record demonstrated better organized 
pattern but again with a very significant amount of muscle artifact in the frontal scalp 
electrodes. Photic stimulation does not active at the record. 
HR: 106 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing 
2. Disorganization. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The degree of muscle artifact might have obscured focal 
or epileptiform features. If epilepsy is an important consi deration, a follow-up study 
capturing sleep is advised.
