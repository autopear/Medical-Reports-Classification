CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old man with metastatic no small-cell lung cancer and seizure disorder presents with trembling, bilateral hands.
	MEDICATIONS:	Keppra, Dilantin, Protonix, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record starts, a clear asymmetry is seen.  Initially the patient is awake during this study.  No appreciable posterior dominant rhythm is seen on either left or right hemispheres.  In the left occipital region, periodic spike and polyspike waves are seen occurring approximately every 1.3 seconds.
As the record continues on the video, a tremor is seen  greater left , as the patient is seen moving around.  This increases with stimulation and the responsiveness of the patient. During these periods of bilateral hand shaking, no change in the record is seen.
At 19:16, the patient is given 2 mg of Ativan and slowing of the record is seen.  There is continuation of the left occipital spike waves at this time.  There is never any evolution of these spikes.  The patient is seen becoming sedated at the end of this record.
	HR:	96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Asymmetry of the background.
2.  Periodic spike waves seen in the left occipital region with periodicity of 1.3 seconds.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is epileptiform activity seen regularly in the left occipital region, which is consistent with an area of irritation. There are no seizures seen on this record.
