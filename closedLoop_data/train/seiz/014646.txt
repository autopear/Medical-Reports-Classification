CLINICAL  HISTORY: This  is  a  55-year-old  male  with  generalized  shaking,  eye deviation to the left, and acute and remote CVA.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, insulin, and Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is perfom1ed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in a confused individual.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: The overall EEG is relatively  well organized. There  is  a 7.5  to  8  Hz  posterior  dominant rhythm and  a low  voltage  pattern.    In wakefulness and in drowsiness, there is intermittent rhythmic theta with some underlying delta and some left anterior temporal sharp waves. These sharp waves consistently occur with the theta, but there  is also some  irregular delta.   Features of drowsiness  include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in rhythmic theta and delta.  In addition, as the pati ent becomes drowsy, some of the left mid-to-anterior temporal activity shifts to the posterior temporal region.
HR:  66BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Left temporal focal slowing with associated sharp waves and rhythmic theta.
2.  Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  This  EEG  supports  a  mild,  diffuse  disturbance  of cerebral function, as well as a focalmechru1ism for seizures.
