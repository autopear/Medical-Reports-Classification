CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old woman with two-days of abdominal pain, chronic pancreatitis, epilepsy and appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Atarax, Vasotec, Morphine, Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient’s electrodes are difficult to place because of her hair weave. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is awake, the EEG is mildly slow with an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and an overall background of approximately 7 to 8 Hz. As she becomes drowsy, there are some technical difficulties and there seems to be an attenuation on the right side, which may be due to the electrode artifact.  Symmetric vertex waves and spindles are seen in sleep.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Somewhat technically limited EEG due to the patient’s hair weave, but abnormal in wakefulness due to:
Mild generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and may be seen in the setting of a diffuse disorder of cerebral function or CNS-acting medications. To perform a better quality record and further evaluate this patient’s epilepsy, a repeat study in the lab with removal of her ornamental braids would be appropriate.
