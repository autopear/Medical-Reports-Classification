	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	72 year-old status post cardiac arrest on September 7 for 25 minutes. Multiple strokes including strokes in the brain stem. Now persistently unresponsive  with head deviation to the left but eyes at midline. Patient blinks but is otherwise not interactive.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin. Folic Acid, Nifedipine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  During the record the patient received phenytoin.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates  a markedly slow, relatively invariant pattern. There is a great deal of muscle artifact. The record demonstrates a continuous generalized essentially invariant periodic pattern. The periodicity is 1.894 Hz. There is an anterior to posterior lag for this discharge. There was also a bit of asymmetry in that it is more prominent from the left than the right. On one occasion stimulation of the patient produces an attenuation of the activity. On all other occasions the activity does not seem to vary with tactile stimulation. Multiple other montages are employed to try and reduce the artifact. The periodic complex is bilateral but with a greater representation on the left than the right with an anterior to posterior lag and with a more anterior component at FP1.
	HR: 	90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  A periodic complex which has a triphasic morphology but which has some atypical features in it. It is more prominent on the left than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The differential for this pattern includes  a post anoxic periodic complex versus triphasic morphology or late status epilepticus pattern. The fact that at least on one occasion the activity reactive to tactile stimulation favors the triphasic conclusion. However, on other occasions the activity remained invariant. These findings were discussed with the clinical team on the day in question.
