CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old male with heart failure admitted with ambulatory dysfunction.
MEDICATIONS: Percocet, Dilantin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated but is awake or asleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When maximally awake, the background EEG is low voltage with a mixture of rhythmic delta and theta.  There are occasional shifting asymmetries.  Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in spontaneous motor and an increase in background delta.  Towards the close of the record, there are more consistently awake portions of the record and there is a suggestion of a posterior rhythm of approximately 7 Hz, although there is a fair amount of artifact at this time.
HR:  90 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Low voltage pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this study. This patientâ€™s medications may play a role in the generalized background slowing as may any diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  To further characterize his epilepsy, a repeat study when he is out of the ICU may be valuable.
