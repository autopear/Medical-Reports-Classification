CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old woman with epilepsy, shoulder pain, cocaine abuse, diabetes, and hypertension. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm. There is intermittent left temporal focal slowing with sharply contoured theta and delta from the left temporal regions, as well as subtle sharp waves. In the transition to and from drowsiness, there is dropout of the posterior dominant rhythm on the left before the right. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. 
Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response of 1 Hz and faster flash frequencies.  Hyperventilation was not performed because of the patientâ€™s coughing. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Left temporal focal slowing and sharply contoured delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are similar to previous studies and support a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  Correlation with imaging is recommended.
