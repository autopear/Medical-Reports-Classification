CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 34-year-old woman with epilepsy for 15 years, last seizure December 2005.  Patient ran out of medicine two to three weeks ago, presented with a tonic-clonic seizure and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Reglan, and Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background, as well as some rhythmic slowing.  Following hyperventilation, there are rare occasions where there is subtle, asymmetric 3 to 4 Hz activity identified from the right hemisphere, particularly in the centroparietal and temporal regions.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  
LAMBDA waves are identified in wakefulness.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Subtle focal slowing from the right hemisphere with rhythmic low voltage delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These features may be correlated with imaging.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
