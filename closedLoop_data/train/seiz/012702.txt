CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed woman with acute renal failure, HIV 
and hypertension but with no history of seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Darvon, Dilantin, Zarontin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is modestly 
slow but relatively well-organized with a 7Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. 
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in rhythmicity 
of the background. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. 
Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. 
HR: 50 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Modest rhythmic background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The findings 
described above are most compatible with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. If 
epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be considered.
