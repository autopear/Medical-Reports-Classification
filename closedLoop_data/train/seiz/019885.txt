HISTORY: 62 yr male with right hemiparesis, confusion and aphasia.
MEDICATION: Dilantin, Protonix, Lopressor, and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-
20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Patient is unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Stage I sleep is characterized  by vertex waves.
HR:  80 BPM
I.MPR   ESSION: EEG within normal limits.
	C 	LINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptifom1features are identified in this record.  Many of the processes, which could have led to unresponsiveness on the 22nd, would be expected to produce a change identifiable on the EEG on the 23rd.
