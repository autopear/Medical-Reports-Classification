CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old with a temporal hemorrhage, possible seizure in
September and a history of COPD. MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ambien, Advir
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   There is a clear interhemispheric asymmetry with focal slowing in the right temporal region.  Drowsiness is characterized  by bursts of generalized background slowing.  The right temporal features include disruption of faster frequency activity.  The patient transitions into stage 1 sleep with vertex waves with K complexes in stage 2 sleep.  The patient is awakened for photic stimulation and during a maximal wakefulness the focal features in the right temporal region are quite subtle and there is a well defined alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation does elicit bilateral driving.
	HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
This EEG supports structural or functional abnormality in
the right temporal region and is congruent with the history provided.  No epileptiform features were observed.
