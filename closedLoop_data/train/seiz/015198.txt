CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 47-year-old woman seizure-free for 15 years.  The patient reports to the tech that at some point she decreased her Dilantin and felt funny so returned to her previous dose of medicine.  Seizures following cerebral abscess many years ago with cocaine ingestion.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a small amount of frontotemporal theta activity which is somewhat irregular and somewhat more marked from the left than the right.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and seems to accentuate that activity.  Following hyperventilation, in the transition to drowsiness, there is again a subtle asymmetry with slightly more left frontotemporal theta compared to the right.  There are one or two bursts of arrhythmic delta activity in the transition to drowsiness.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  	HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slowing characterized by theta and rare delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports an underlying structural or functional abnormality in the left frontotemporal region. Compared to previous studies, no epileptiform features were seen.
