CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 79-year-old woman who passed out prior to admission with generalized weakness.  Work-up for stroke versus seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, insulin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Bilateral temporal wicket spikes are seen in this record.  There is occasional occurrence of independent left or right temporal delta in relaxed wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation elicits a symmetric driving response.   
HR:  64 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Oddly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Shifting temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The finding in this EEG is non-specific and can be seen in patients with underlying cerebrovascular disease.  However, in the context of the patient's normal background, in order to rule out epilepsy, a repeat outpatient study capturing more extensive portions of sleep would be useful.
