CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old male who was originally admitted with stroke and found to be in cardiac respiratory arrest with an overall resuscitation time of 30 minutes. The patient is comatose and ECS protocol was required by Dr. Azizi.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Trileptal, Baclofen, Lidocaine, pressors, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG and additional ECS montage for electric cortical silence. The patient is comatose after coding. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly suppressed with some artifacts from the ICU, which are most likely not cerebral.  No definite cerebral activity was seen and no epileptiform activity was identified.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
No definite cerebral activity with a markedly suppressed background.
Intermittent artifacts, probably not cerebral in nature.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Alternative testing is recommended such as cerebral blood flow study.
