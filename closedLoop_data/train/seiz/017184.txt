CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 26-year-old male with seizure onset in 1996, seizure-free for four years.  
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and well organized.  There is a 10 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm, which is well attenuated with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation slightly increases the slow activity of theta in the background. Sleep was not achieved.  
Photic stimulation elicits driving. 
HR:  54 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.
