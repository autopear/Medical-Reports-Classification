CLINICAL HISTORY:  81 year old female with multiple intracerebral hemorrhages  and complex partial epilepsy. Seizures characterized  by eye deviation to the left, tonic movements  of face, head and neck, lasting seconds. Evaluate for hemorrhagic  stroke and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Nexium, ISS, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is relatively disorganized and more of a diffuse pattern with occasional bursts of FIRDA. As the recording continues, the patient awakens and when she does so there is a theta frequency posterior dominant rhythm, higher amplitude on the left. Following this, she drifts off to sleep. Shifting asymmetries are observed in the record and the activity is slightly higher amplitude  on the left compared  to the right. In relaxed wakefulness,  the overall background is relatively low voltage, increasing  with
stimulation.
HR:   72 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background  slowing and disorganization.
	2. 	Bursts of FIRDA.
	3. 	Prominent shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite the clear history of a definitive, focal hemorrhagic abnormality, this EEG demonstrates more of a generalized  or bi-hemispheric pattern. No epileptiform features were observed.
