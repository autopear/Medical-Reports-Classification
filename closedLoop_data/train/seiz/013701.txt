CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old status post craniectomy on the left for MVA. Previous neurosurgery in 2004. This patient is ascribed as having various acute head traumas of different types.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Morphine, Vecuronium, Codeine,  Oxacillin, Phenytoin, Tyenol, Acetaminophen
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is very abnormal.  There is a clear breach rhythm with accentuation of beta frequency activity on the left. The overall pattern is slow with primarily theta on the left and immature theta and some arrhythmic delta on the right. In the contest of a breach rhythm, there are occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves, maximum at F-7.
	HR:	60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Background slowing and disorganization.
	2.	Interhemispheric asymmetry.
	3.	Left anterior temple sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   Breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following the craniotomy. The sharp waves are localized to the left. Many of these features have been seen in previous studies.
