CLINICAL HISTORY:   44 year-old male who had a fall while standing and developed a loss of consciousness  and facial trauma. History of refractory to treatment.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Famotidine, Ancef
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is relatively low voltage but, there is a glimpse of a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta. There are brief portions in the drowsy record where there is a little bit of rhythmic slowing in the left frontotemporal region. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy and elicited minimal driving.
	HR: 	84 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Modest generalized background slowing.
	2. 	Intermittent focal slowing from the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests at least a structural function abnormality on the left. Correlation with imaging is appropriate.
