CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 56-year-old woman evaluated for clinical versus subclinical seizures following exploratory laparotomy, ileectomy, and ileostomy on 5/3/06.   
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and morphine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is stimulated and tested throughout the EEG.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a relatively low voltage pattern, which is subtly discontinuous with brief bursts of relatively homogenous rhythmic theta and mixed delta followed by brief portions of attenuation or slower lower voltage delta.  The sections with attenuation are approximately two seconds in duration.  Stimulation of the patient produces some artifact, but also seems to give a small increase in background theta.  No clinical responses are noted to the stimulation.  
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, subtly discontinuous pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To put this record into the appropriate clinical context, it is important to know the doses and degrees of Ativan and morphine this patient has received, as these medications could contribute to this record.  In all, this EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral dysfunction as can be seen with large doses of sedative hypnotic medications, severe toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, or other severe diffuse disturbances of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were identified.  There was some small evidence of reactivity to stimuli.
