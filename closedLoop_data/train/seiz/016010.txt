CLINICAL HISTORY: 53-year-old gentleman found to have a seizure. Image study 
shows left frontal ICH, Agitation. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and 
sedated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly abnormal. The 
overall background is of mixed theta, beta and smaller amounts of delta. In addition, 
there are nearly continuous left frontal sharp and slow wave complexes. There is also 
some disruption of faster frequency activity in the same region and an amplitude 
accentuation. Simulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record. The 
amplitude accentuation suggests an underlying breech rhythm. There is however, no 
craniotomy. There is little in the way of reactivity to external stimuli. There is variability in 
the record with some sections of the record richer in delta activity than others. The 
laboratory contacted the clinical team regarding the presence of nearly continuous left 
temporal sharp waves with as many as 7 left temporal sharp waves in a 1 0 second 
period. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing. 
2. Nearly continuous left frontal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality in the left 
frontal region as well as a markedly irritated focus. No clinical seizures were observed in 
this 20 minute record.
