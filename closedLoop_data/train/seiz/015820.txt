CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year-old, postpartum woman admitted with increasing intracerebral 
hemorrhages in the left hemisphere. Over the patient's acute presentation, the hemorrhages 
expanded and she required immediate neurosurgical interventiora Vasculitis. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Morphine, Codeine, Acetaminophen, Insulin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, but responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is an interhemispheric 
asymmetry. Despite the craniotomy on the left, amplitude of background activity is higher on 
the right compared to the left. The overall background is relatively low voltage. At times the 
right hemispheres demonstrates alpha frequency activity, particularly with stimulation. There 
are brief portions where there is a well defined awake pattern on the right with a reactive alpha 
rhythm on the right. The left hemisphere demonstrates disruption of faster frequency activity, 
lower voltage pattern with delta. As the patient drifts off to sleep, beta activity is seen in the 
central regions, right more so than the left. Occasional FIRDA is observed. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Lower voltage suppressed pattern on the left with disruption of faster frequency activity. 
2. FIRDA 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the magnitude of this patient's abnormalities in the left 
hemisphere, the right hemisphere is remarkably preserved. No epileptiform features are 
observed.
