	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	Adult onset epilepsy March 2006, last seizure May
6, 2007 with tonic-clonic activity, incontinence and confusion lasting
	3-5 minutes. MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using
standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation, photic stimulation are completed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	The waking record has a great deal of muscle and movement artifact. There is a 10-hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. In the transition to sleep vertex waves, spindles and K complexes are identified in stage 2 sleep. There was a question at one point with some rhythmic sign from the left in the transition to sleep but the quality of the EEG at that point is not acceptable. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep but
does elicit minimal driving. HR: 60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION:	EEG within normal limits wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	No epileptiform features were seen. Generous beta may be due to benzodiazepine exposure, anxiety or other causes. Additional recording to further characterize this individual's epilepsy is appropriate.
