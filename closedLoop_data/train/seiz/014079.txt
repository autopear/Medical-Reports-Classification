CLINICAL HISTORY:   89 year old with acute change in mental status, aneurysm clip, epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, Versed, Etomidate, Sux., Vee., Lidocaine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed  at bedside using standard 10 20
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is extremely agitated and is moving about followed by somnolence.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In the few portions of the record where the patient is not moving about, the background EEG is low voltage.  There seems to be a breech rhythm with accentuation of beta activity seen particularly in the left temporal region and sometimes in the right frontal region as well.  This is always followed by movement of
the patient and agitation.· The patient's movements  are so vigorous that she is knocking off the electrodes.
HR:   90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG but due to:
		1. 	Background slowing. 	·
CLINICAL CORR ELATION: This is this patient's 3rd EEG and is the least successful to date.  Previous EEGs have demonstrated breech rhythm as identified here with the accentuation of beta activity.  Previous epileptiform activity was on the left.
