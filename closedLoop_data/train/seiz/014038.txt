CLINICAL HISTORY:   89 year old male with left craniotomy for subdural hematoma evacuation.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Coreg, Zocor, lsosorbide,  Hydralazine, Dilantin, Labetalol, Metoprolol, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION: Continue digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal, low voltage suppressed pattern with high amplitude sharp waves in the left hemisphere. There is a generous field of spread central temporal.	The remaining EEG is relatively low voltage theta and in fact slightly discontinuous.  There is some alpha frequency activity observed. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity.
	HR: 	N/A
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Almost a discontinuous pattern.
	2. 	Markedly slow background.
	3.	High amplitude sharp wave in the left and spike activity in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The sharp waves are compatible with known structural abnormality on the left. The background slowing is concerning. It is supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and correlation with this patient's sedative hypnotic medications, and overall acute neurologic problems is advised.
