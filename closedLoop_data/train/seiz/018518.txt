CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 29-year-old woman with new onset seizures with tonic-clonic activity, ten minutes of postictal confusion, but no incontinence. 
MEDICATIONS: Tylenol, Percocet, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30  V posterior dominant rhythm identified bilaterally with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In maximal wakefulness, there is excessive theta for an adult of this age.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, which produces an increase in the amplitude of the background, left slightly greater than the right.  Following this, the patient becomes drowsy with hypersynchronous, rhythmic theta followed by vertex waves.  The drowsy and stage I sleep pattern is symmetric. Abundant POSTS are seen in stage I sleep.  
Photic stimulation is performed and elicits a LAMBDA as well as a prominent driving response.  The driving includes a sharply contoured driving response at 5 Hz.  The patient seems to drift off to sleep with POSTS identified in between the photic.  On one occasion, photic at 17 Hz elicits synchronous, sharply contoured bursts but no spike/wave activity.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Excess background theta in wakefulness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with prominent LAMBDA and POSTS who is sleepy during photic stimulation, the response in photic is of unclear significance.  Consideration for a patient who is falling asleep during photic stimulation versus an unusual photoparoxysmal response should be explored with a follow-up EEG and additional stage II sleep as well as photic stimulation.
