C        LINICAL HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old  male with a right fi:ontal skull  defect, epilepsy,  hypertension,   stroke,   hepatitis,   alcohol   abuse   with   alcohol   withdrawal associated severe paranoia
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and Topiramate.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed in the lab using  standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was attempted and photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized, low voltage, with generous low voltage beta activity and a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 9 Hz.  Hyperventilation is attempted early on in the record, but the patient is either  not cooperati ve or is excessively drowsy.   Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in background beta.   Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.   Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is initially asleep, but does elicit a brief driving response.
HR:  78 BPM. IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epil eptiform features were identified in this
record.  There is a generous amow1t ofbeta  frequency activity, which is to be anticipated with benzodiazepine use.
