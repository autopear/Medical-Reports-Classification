	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	Twenty-five-year-old male with epilepsy since infancy, MRI abnormalities with a parietal gliosis and question hippocampal atrophy.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, valproate, phenobarbital, others.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The recording is performed because the patient had become extremely sedated after phenobarbital was added to his valproate. He continues to feel sleepy during this EEG.
	DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG demonstrates a pattern of diffuse slowing with rhythmic theta interrupted by delta. Arousals are characterized by an increase in delta. There is occasional rhythmic, somewhat shifting slowing. There are a handful of bursts of sharply contoured activity in the left midÂ­ temporal region.
	HR: 	60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to prominent background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a significant underlying encephalopathy which may be toxic or metabolic. No seizures were recorded.
