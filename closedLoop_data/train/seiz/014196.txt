CLINICAL HISTORY:  88 year old woman status post fall with subdural hematoma, evacuation on 06/11.  Further evacuation 06/16.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra,  Protonix, Hydrochlorothiazide,  Lisinopril, Levothyroxine, Sotalol, Codeine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 sysrtem of electrode placement and 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins, an intrahemispheric asymmetry is seen.  The right hemisphere remains low voltage and suppressed with occasional theta and delta activity. In the left hemisphere periodic spike waves are seen  in P3 or F3 periodically occurring every 0.6 to 0.8 seconds.  At times they seem to quicken, but there is no evolution of this pattern.  During stimulation there is no change in the EEG pattern.
	HR:	78 bpm and irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Asymmetry of the background with a suppressed pattern seen in the right hemisphere.
	2. 	Continuous sharps in the left hemisphere in the P3 F3 distribution
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record is very similar to patient's most recent study. The left frontoparietal sharp waves are regular but there is no seizure activity recorded on this record. The suppressed pattern in the right hemisphere is consistent with a structural abnormality.  Presently no reactivity to stimulation.
