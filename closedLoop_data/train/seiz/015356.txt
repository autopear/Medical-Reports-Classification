CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 84-year-old male with acute renal failure secondary to dehydration, cardiac abnormalities, two tonic-clonic seizures with postictal confusion, multiple strokes, and amputations. 
MEDICATIONS: Aricept, Synthroid, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. This digital EEG is re-reviewed with all the appropriate montages, but during the recording the tech observes that she was unable to reformat the record, although that does not alter the ability to interpret this record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized.  There is excess theta in the background.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 to 8 Hz, which at times is better identified on the left compared to the right.  On other occasions, the background is symmetric.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
	An occasional asymmetric alpha rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  There are subtle features to suggest that this process may in fact impact the right hemisphere differently than the left.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Correlation with imaging may be valuable.
