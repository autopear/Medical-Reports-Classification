CLINICAL HISTORY:   48-year-old  male with unknown handedness  with right brain injury 4 years ago. The patient subsequently  went on to have 4 seizures, last June 2007, which were tonic-clonic with tongue-biting, loss of consciousness, and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient has a cranial defect with a burR hole on the right frontal and parietal regions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Wakefulness, there is a well organized background with a
10 Hz, 60 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. A breech rhythm is identified from the right hemisphere with accentuation of beta activity in the frontal regions and a bit of arrhythmic flowing in the right posterior temporal region. Hyperventilation produces an accentuation of the breech rhythm by producing an increase in frontal delta. Drowsiness is characterized  by an accentuation of focal slowing with
the appearance  of a 3 to 4 Hz activity from the right hemisphere and sharp waves from the right
temporal region, maximum in the posterior temporal distribution. As the patient becomes drowsier, some of these have a temporoparietal maximum. Vertex waves phase are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation  elicits scant driving, bilaterally.
	HR: 	78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Focal slowing from the right, particularly  the temporal and parietal regions.
	2. 	Sharp waves T6 or P4 maximum.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality  involving gray and white matter on the right. These findings are congruent with a description of past epilepsy surgery. The breech rhythm in an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
