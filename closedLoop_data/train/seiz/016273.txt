	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	Twenty-four-year-old, Xanax withdrawal versus epilepsy versus non-epileptic seizures. This is the baseline.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, Ambien, Xanax.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably organized for age. There is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There are intermittent bursts of somewhat irregular, frontally predominant slowing. The slowing is approximately 3 hertz and there is a suspicion of an underlying sharp wave. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does seem to accentuate a bifrontal sharp wave which is somewhat irregular in appearance but is bilateral. The characteristic mitten-shaped 3-5 hertz spike and wave activity is not apparent, more of an irregular bifrontal burst. Following hyperventilation as the patient becomes drowsy there is some vertex activity. In addition, the somewhat irregular bursts of frontally predominant with an underlying notch component persists. Most bursts are brief in duration. Photic stimulation does not activate the
record.
HR: 74 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to irregular bursts of notched frontal slowing.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	These features are of unclear clinical significance. Consideration for an underlying epileptiform
		disturbance is appropriate.	Additional EEG recording is suggested.
