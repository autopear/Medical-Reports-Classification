CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old gentleman with right leg swelling, ESRD, history of seizures, and hip fracture.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Haldol, many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as drowsy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily rhythmic theta frequency activity of 5 to 7 Hz.  There are smaller amounts of faster frequency activity.  There are frontally predominant, relatively synchronous triphasic waves seen throughout the record.  On one occasion, there may be some asymmetries, somewhat more remarkable on the left than the right. Stimulation of the patient produces eye opening and eye closure and with swallowing, there seems to be a brief attenuation of the triphasic activity.
HR:  104 BPM, slightly irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  The triphasic waves are typically a manifestation of underlying metabolic encephalopathy including hepatic encephalopathy, renal insufficiency, or medication exposure.  The asymmetry of the Triphasic waves, with prominence on the left, may be due to this patientâ€™s preexisting history of epilepsy and/or structural brain disease.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
