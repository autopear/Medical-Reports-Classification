CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old man admitted initially for acute liver failure with upper Gl bleeding was getting discharged but the patient fell and hit his face and with bilateral subdural hematoma and received emergent surgery, now with seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Ativan, Dilantin and others.
INTRODUCTION:   Portal digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. The patient is in coma, intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the beginning of the tracing, the background EEG is significantly disorganized. The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm cannot be recognized. Instead, throughout tracing, slow spike and wave or triphasic  activity was seen throughout with 1 to 1.5 Hz in frequency. Stimulation of the patient did not change the background  significantly.
A phase reversal focus with sharp and spike activity can be seen in the bilateral frontal and central areas.
Heart rate 78 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Disorganized background.
	2. 	Absence of alpha rhythm.
	3. 	Diffuse slow spike and slow wave activity as well as triphasic activity.
	4. 	Focal discharge in the bilateral frontal and central area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG tracing demonstrates a significant cerebral dysfunction involving in the cortex gray matter and subcortical white matter diffusely. It can be seen in the metabolic encephalopathy such as hepatic as well as the other etiologies including structural lesion. The prognosis is guarded basically based on his generalized medical condition improvement. Clinical correlation is recommended.
