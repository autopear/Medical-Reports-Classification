CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 47-year-old male with childhood epilepsy since age 11; last seizure about one week ago.  Seizures are usually generalized with auras.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an unusual pattern.  There are brief portions of the record where the EEG is well organized from low to medium amplitude with an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  This pattern alternates with an awake pattern that is not as well organized, higher amplitude with slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, and variability of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Epileptiform activity is identified in the record, which is complex in nature.  Sometimes the epileptiform activity occurs with additional, higher amplitude slower bursts of more paroxysmal theta.  At other times, they occur in a more discrete fashion.  The epileptiform activity identified in this record includes bursts of frontally predominant, well-defined 4 to 6.5 Hz spike and slow wave activity, as well as more clearly focal spikes including subtle focal spikes at T6 and C4, C4/CZ, as well as more subtle sharp waves in the posterior regions, right or left.  Photic stimulation is performed early on in the record and appears to accentuate some of the generalized spike and slow wave activity.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there are additional bursts of spike and slow wave activity, which are more prolonged in nature, varying in terms of shifting from the right or left frontal regions, but without a clear build up in terms of a sustained spike and slow discharge.  This can be seen at 14:02.  Photic stimulation produces an increase in theta and may to some extent accentuate the frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant 4 to 6.5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.
Focal spike and slow wave activity with variable maximum in the record including the posterior regions, right centrotemporal, or independent through either hemisphere.
Intermittent paroxysmal slowing of two natures: one more subtle, occurring in relaxed wakefulness; another, higher amplitude, seeming to occur in association with the epileptiform activity. 
Photoparoxysmal response. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform features described above are complex.  They support a generalized mechanism for this patientâ€™s epilepsy, which may include either a secondary generalized mechanism or a dual diagnosis: more than one possible contributor for his epilepsy including an inherited trait plus focal areas of epileptogenesis.
