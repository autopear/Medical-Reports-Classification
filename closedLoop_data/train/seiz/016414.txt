CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year-old-male, status post gunshot wound to the head, with 
ventriculostomy, sedated and paralyzed. To evaluate for seizures. 
Fentanyl, Vecuronium, Ativan. Dilantin, Insulin, Gentamicin, Mannitol, 
Norepinephrine, Ancef. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and 
poorly responsive, but is stimulated during the study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a pharmacologic 
pattern with generous, frontal beta activity and slow delta observed in the posterior 
region. The slow delta is somewhat slower on the right in comparison to the left. 
Stimulation of the patient produces some eye movement but no clear alerting. There is 
a small degree of variability in terms of the quantity of beta observed in the background. 
HR: 60 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a pattern with generous beta activity in the 
frontal regions and slow delta in the posterior regions, right greater than left. 
CLINICAL The use of sedative hypnotic medications may play a role 
in the generous beta. No epileptiform features were seen. The delta, which is slower on 
the right compared to the left may be correlated with imaging and other findings.
