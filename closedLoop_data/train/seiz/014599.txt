CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old male with renal failure, subdural hematoma, and right-sided burr hole, admitted three days ago. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Zofran, Lovenox, Codeine, Acetaminophen, Enalapril, Renagel, Phoslo, Calcium, Cardizem, Nephro-Caps, Zocor, Procardia, Cipro, Pantoprazole, Zofran, Dilantin, Lovenox 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is agitated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the patient begins, the overall pattern demonstrates a relatively low voltage pattern in an awake individual with low voltage theta present bilaterally. There is a bit more slow delta on the right which appeared. This observation is confounded by head rocking. Rare vertex waves are observed but stage 1 sleep is not sustained. 
HR: 60-90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Relatively low voltage slow background. 
2. Somewhat slower pattern observed on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are noted. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. No epileptiform features are noted.
