CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 71-year-old male with pancreatitis and right facial twitching.  EEG was recorded for right facial twitching.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as having right facial twitching.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern from the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates high amplitude spike and slow wave activity, maximum in the left hemisphere but with a generous field of spread throughout the left hemisphere and a marked after going slow wave, sometimes lasting more than one second.  In addition, there is some poly spike or fast activity in the left hemisphere.  Occasionally, the twitching produces muscle artifact from the right face.  The patient is on the video EEG.  His right face is turned towards the camera.  The motor activity cannot be seen with the resolution of the camera; however, of note, the patient looks to the left and moves the left side spontaneously, but not the right.  The patient has some oral automatisms, which apparently are part of his activity.  Rare bursts of fast activity are seen from the right.  As the recording continues, there was a report that Levetiracetam was administered. This does not impact the EEG, although the time of the dose was not recorded.  Phenobarbital was also added during this epoch.  By 5:00 AM on the morning of the 29th, the epileptiform activity has begun to slow down, but has not disappeared.  
Long-Term EEG Monitoring, November 29, 2006 to November 30, 2006
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG during this time continues to show the periodic high amplitude left hemispheric sharps, maximum in the temporal regions.   The patient is examined at 10:29:09.  Stimulation of the patient clearly decreases the discontinuity of the EEG, but increases both some faster frequency activity and some muscle, but the oral facial movements persist, are well visualized on the video, and are not impacted by tactile stimulation.  By the late evening on the 29th, the electrode integrity is progressively lost.  The epileptiform activity has abated at some time, with at times as few as eight discharges in a ten-second period.  At times the epileptiform activity can be seen bilaterally and when the patient is sleeping, the EEG is relatively discontinuous.  The EEG is sampled into pieces and at the end of one specific segment, there is a discontinuous pattern with poly spike and wave activity noted from the left, which is also picked up on the contralateral side.  No clinical signs seem to be associated with the activity at that time, and it seems as if the mouth movements decrease while the patient is sleeping despite the ongoing appearance on the EEG.  
An additional piece of data is provided on 11/30/06.  The patient is not in the room and there is no EEG data.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Essentially continuous periodic complexes from the left which, when the video can be identified, seems to be associated with facial twitching without actual build up. 
	Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern may be considered a form of epilepsy partialis continua given the focal motor activity.  Despite a very abnormal background, at least in the beginning of the EEG, the patient is awake and interactive as could be seen in this syndrome.
