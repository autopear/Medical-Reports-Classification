CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 79-year-old male who presents after an episode of confusion and slurred speech with generalized weakness.  Current work-up for stroke versus seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Seroquel, and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is slightly disorganized with an 8.5 Hz, 50 to 55 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is subtle focal slowing appreciated over the right hemisphere best seen on TFOT montage.  Occasional asymmetric alpha activity, which is less prominent on the right is seen.  The background is mildly slow for the patientâ€™s age. There are rare P4 sharp waves identified.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, and the focal features appear to be more prominent. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle right hemispheric slowing.
P4 sharp waves. 
Asymmetric alpha rhythm.
Mildly overall slow background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a subtle anomaly involving the right hemisphere and could explain the partial mechanism for epilepsy.  Correlation with imaging data is valuable.  A repeat tracing in an outpatient setting under sleep deprived conditions in order to capture deeper stages of sleep is appropriate.
