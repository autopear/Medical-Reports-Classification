CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 77-year-old woman with an intracerebral hemorrhage with right-hand jerking noted on 8/9/06.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is noted to bite down on the endotracheal tube, but there is no observation that the patient is experiencing hand twitching.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a mixture of diffuse arrhythmic delta activity with smaller amounts of alpha and theta frequency activity. There are shifting asymmetries with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity from the right compared to the left. There is a sharp wave with an unusual field including left anteriotemporal and T2, which is right.  Variability in the record is identified with some portions richer in beta and alpha frequency activity, as well as evidence of rhythmicity as the patient becomes drowsy.  There are also a handful of right frontal, low amplitude sharp waves.  No mention is made as to whether or not the patient is experiencing jerking with those, and it is not possible to see such on the video.  
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
		Marked background slowing with prominent arrhythmic delta activity.
		Rare right frontal sharp waves.
	3.	Unusual left anteriotemporal sharp waves with a field that involves T2.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with an intracerebral hemorrhage, stimulation does produce a reactive pattern, richer in faster frequency activity, which is a reassuring finding.  There are rare sharp waves identified in this record in the right frontal region and another in the left anteriotemporal.  The sharp wave picked up in the left anteriotemporal region may in fact be generated in the T2 region.  No seizures were recorded.
