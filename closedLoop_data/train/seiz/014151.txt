CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old left-handed male with previous frontal craniotomies presents with 3 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with postictal confusion, fall, and a dislocated left shoulder. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Heparin, Nexium, Tylenol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation is performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an alpha rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is generous beta activity identified in the background, a brief rhythm in the frontal regions, and accentuation of beta in that area. There also appears to be a left frontal cranial abnormality. Features of sleep include vertex waves, spindles. In sleep the beta activity is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right, but there are no definitive sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits no driving. Occasional frontal delta is observed, left greater than the right. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Frontal delta, left greater than right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no definite sharp waves present. The excess beta could be due to medications. Breech rhythm is an anticipated finding after craniotomy and can make the identification of epileptiform activity more troublesome.
