CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old with head trauma, gunshot wound to the left hand and right leg, epilepsy, stroke, drug abuse, ad mitted with confusion. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Benadryl, Acetaminophen, Thiamine, Folic Acid, Lovenox 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation nor photic simulation completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is quite drowsy, maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The alpha rhythm is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. In addition, there is intermittent, rhythmic theta observed from the left frontal region. Features of stage 2 sleep include K complexes and spindles. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Rhythmic left frontal 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. This slowing described above may be correlated with imaging. In this individual with epilepsy, a repeat study with hyperventilation may be helpful.
