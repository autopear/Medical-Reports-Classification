CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year-old, right handed woman with a epilepsy since age 3, 
complicated by adult onset malaria. US resident with foreign travel. Last seizure 2007 
which was tonic-clonic with loss of consciousness and loss of awareness. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation were performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness background EEG includes a 10 Hz 
alpha rhythm which is 50 microvolts on the right. It is lower amplitude but equally 
represented on the left. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an 
increased amplitude of the background. Hyperventilation produces the symptom of 
dizziness. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with rhythmic 
theta. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral 
driving. 
HR: 60 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. There 
was some problem with the F4 electrode at the close of the record but the majority of 
the record is interpretable.
