CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed male with recurrent seizures, admitted with breakthrough seizures receiving Dilantin and Ativan in the emergency room. Refractory epilepsy, multiple strokes, left ocular blindness. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Acetaminophen 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This EEG is remarkable for an uncomfortable individual with a great deal of artifact. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a pattern with muscle artifact and low voltage fast. As the low voltage fast activity abates, the overall background is one of theta with occasional bursts of rhythmic delta of approximately 1.5 Hertz. The delta is a bit more remarkable on the left. The patient has a great deal of difficulty participating with the testing. 
HR: 84bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage beta and theta pattern. 
2. Occasional left frontal delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is slower than this patient's previous studies. The left frontal delta slowing has previously been described. No temporal sharp waves were identified at this time. This is a technically limited EEG due to the patient√Üs agitation.
