CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old male with epilepsy 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Ativan, Percocet, Fentanyl patch, Lovenox, Dilantin, Loraepam, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake through stage II sleep. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the EEG with drowsiness versus stage II sleep. Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and abundant beta activity are noted. Arousals include a brief alpha rhythm and some central mu. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. 
HR: 80 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. This is identical to a previous study in November 2009 which identified normal EEG and the long term monitor with multiple events without EEG correlate.
