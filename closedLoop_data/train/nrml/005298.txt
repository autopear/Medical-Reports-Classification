CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old female with multiple seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, ASA, Ciprofloxacin 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Due to refractory status epilepticus the patient receives multiple medications, including versed drip, followed by phenobarbital. She develops hypotension with the use of versed. She is intubated and poorly response. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG monitor continues to demonstrate repetitive spike and polyspike activity in the right posterior quadrant, including C4, T6, with spread to T4. The activity can occur in brief bursts and runs. There is some volume conduction to the left. Intermittently the pattern includes a burst suppression pattern. The activity is reviewed up until 2:00p.m. and again the polyspike activity and burst suppression pattern is noted. 
Of note, although the pattern persists, by the overnight recording, with medications employed there is a much clear transition to a burst suppression pattern, particularly on the right. The left hemisphere clearly demonstrates the impact of the anesthetic medications by 2:00p.m. with a much slower pattern. 
HR: 60-104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: There is no conclusion because we are still recording, but the interval impression is ongoing, refractory focal status epilepticus with a burst suppression background. 
LONG TERM MONITORING 11-26-03/1312011 TO 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and essentially comatose. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Keppra, Lacosamide, Vimpat 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the patient's immobility over the course of the EEG monitoring sessions, many of the electrodes are lost. The initial sections of the record include a very suppressed pattern on the right with intermittent spike and wave activity. In this section of the record, the spike and wave activity is occurring as infrequently as once every 20 seconds. The background on the left is mixed frequency slow pattern but the right hemisphere is essentially a suppressed pattern particularly in the right temporal and posterior quadrant. There is high amplitude polyspike or fast activity noted. 
On the morning of 3/14/2011, as the patient's medications are adjusted, the background is a bit more vigorous in both hemispheres and the epileptiform activity starts to increase to pairs with bursts lasting less than a second but is mainly one burst every 6 to 7 seconds. The left hemisphere demonstrates an increase in the vigorous pattern with a mixed frequency pattern. 
HR: 96 bpm 
INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL: This day the EEG monitoring is remarkable for an initial pattern with very suppressed and infrequent epileptiform activity followed by activity which is seen in brief isolated bursts but no build up. Additional EEG monitoring will follow.
