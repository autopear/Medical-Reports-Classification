CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male status post code on December 9 with status epilepticus including nonconvulsive status epilepticus on the 1Oth resolved on the 12th with addition of propofol. Seizures stopped abruptly on the morning of the 11th. Now comatose with some brain stem signs and rare twitching in the legs. 

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Flagyl 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low voltage suppressed pattern. There is scant isolated cerebral activity identified from either hemisphere. This very low voltage record can be reviewed using multiple different techniques. There is a bit of eye movement artifact and the suggestions of occasional isolated slow delta. Stimulation of the patient does not seem to accentuate the cerebral activity. 
HR: 112 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly suppressed background. 
CLINICAL These findings support a severe cerebral insult in that sedative hypnotic medications were discontinued many days ago, these findings are extremely worrisome in terms of the severity of CNS insult. In addition, they may be correlated with the patient's CT finding of cerebral edema.
