INTRODUCTION: 
A routine EEG was performed using the 10 to 20 standard electrode placement system with EKG electrodes. The record only includes wakefulness and activation procedures were not performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Coreg, insulin, Flomax, Keppra, Lovenox, Norvasc, vancomycin, and Zosyn. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
Increased movement artifact and frontal electrode artifact. 
HISTORY: 
81 year-old male with dementia, seizures, diabetes, previous stroke with left-sided hemiparesis now with change in mental status, and hallucinations. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 
EEG opens up to a diffusely slow background wave in the theta/delta range with slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm at best reaching 7Hz and 20 to 70 uV, which appears to react to symmetrically to eye opening. There is mild to moderate amount of beta present frontally at 15 to 25 Hz and with amplitude of 10 to 13 microvolts. Sleep was not seen during the study. Hyperventilation of photic stimulation were not performed. The technician notes that the patient is hallucinating during the record. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
1. Generalized slow waves at 4 to 7 HZ and amplitude of 20 to 30 microvolts. 
2. Focal slow waves at F8/T4 seen continuously at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and 20-75 microvolts. 
SEIZURES: 
No. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to mild-to-moderate generalized diffuse slow waves and right fronto-temporal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right-fronto temporal region, which is consistent with the known stroke. In addition there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebellar dysfunction, which is non-specific with regard to etiology and may be seen in toxic metabolic disturbances, bilateral cerebral disease and at times in neurodegenerative diseases. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
