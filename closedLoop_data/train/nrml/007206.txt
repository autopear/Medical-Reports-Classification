CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old female who was found down. She is status post left craniotomy for ICH and subdural hematoma. She also has a history of alcohol abuse. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Keppra, Gentamicin, Thiamine, Folate Acid, Sera. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient has a low amplitude background with beta and delta activity. The left side of the brain is very attenuated and at times there is rhythmic delta. Intermittent left posterior and occipital region sharp waves are present. No photic stimulation or hyperventilation performed. No seizure activity. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Low voltage. 
2. Diffuse slowing of background with beta and delta. 
3. Attenuated left side of the brain. 
4. Sharp waves were demonstrated in the left posterior and occipital region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was demonstrated. Focal slowing may be related to structural abnormality, medication or metabolic process.
