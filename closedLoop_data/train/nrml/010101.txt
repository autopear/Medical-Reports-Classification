CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old gentleman with coronary artery disease, renal failure, GI bleed, left MCA Infarct in February 2010, now with a possible seizure and possible postictal confusion on September 26, 2010.
 
MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone, Coreg, Celexa, Coumadin, Aspirin, Plavix, Dilantin, Heparin. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a medium frequency background with generous beta. There is excess background theta. Throughout much of the record the background is symmetric, although on occasion there is a bit more isolated mixed theta delta from the left hemisphere. Features of drowsiness include a decrease in motor activity. 
HR: 90 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing and poor organization. 
2. In this somewhat limited record, occasional focal delta from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The excess beta may be due to this patient's medications. The excess theta supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. In this individual with a past history of stroke, there is lit11e in the way of focal findings, but those that are present are in the region of this patient's previous infarct.
