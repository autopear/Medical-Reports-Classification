CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male with recurrent seizures over the weekend with 
confusion and left sided twitching. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenobarbital, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intermittently 
somnolent. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates high amplitude, periodic 
sharp waves in the right hemisphere with a generous field, including anterior temporal, posterior temporal, and occipital. In contrast to the previous epileptiform activity, this activity clearly starts anteriorly and moves posteriorly, where as the activity over the weekend was more posterior. Today's epileptiform activity is high amplitude and periodic in nature. There are actually bursts in trains of epileptiform activity. This can be demonstrated at 11 :59 p.m. The background from the left hemisphere is primarily a theta frequency pattern. As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is a great deal of muscle or motion artifact, but the epileptiform activity remains unchanged. 
HR: 60-90 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. A status epilepticus pattern with prominent epileptiform activity from the right occipital and temporal region. 
2. Definitive frequency evolution of that activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform activity described above is congruent 
with a clinical symptomatology. It is much more prominent than that seen on April 30, 2011. This EEG is diagnostic of a complex partial status epilepticus.
