CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old male with complex partial epilepsy admitted with recurrent seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, ASA, Lovenox, Lorazepam, Nifedipine, Hydralazine, Folate Acid. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm of 30 mcv and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. There are frequent left anterior sharp waves which occur in bursts and trains. They persist into stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Left anterior temporal discrete spike and wave activity. 
2. Reverse of left temporal sharp waves with focal slowing 
3. Slowing of the alpha rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were identified in previous EEGs. The background slowing noted today may be due to postictal state or age-related changes.
