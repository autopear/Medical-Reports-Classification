CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old woman with dialysis, abrupt change in mental status, 
confusion and headaches. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Advair, Nephrocap, Phoslo, ASA, Lantus, Lisinopril, 
Metoprolol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard placement 
with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not possible. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates an asymmetric 
pattern. The left hemisphere demonstrates a great deal of artifacts, but a relatively 
continuous pattern primarily composed of mixed alpha and theta frequency activity. The 
right hemisphere demonstrates a marked disruption of faster frequency activity on the 
right. In addition, FIRDA and eye movement artifacts are observed. Occasional bursts of 
generalized delta are noted. Photic stimulation demonstrates scant driving on the left. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked interhemispheric asymmetry. 
2. Slowing on the right with significant disruption of faster frequency activity. 
3. Moderate slowing on the left with mixed frequency background rich in alpha 
and theta frequency activity. 
4. Occasional bursts of generalized of generalized delta. 
CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Consideration for a 
structural process on the right Is advised.
