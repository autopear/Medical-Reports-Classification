CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old male with Noonan syndrome, learning disability, cardiac 
disorder and recurrents status epilepticus. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan. Dilantin, Keppra 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system or electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. As the recording 
continues, the patient becomes increasingly active and starts to remove his EEG electrodes. 
Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This was a 4 hour study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In this challenging bedside recording, the background EEG 
is diffusely slow with delta and increasing amounts of beta. As the patient moves about. there is 
muscle and motion artifact. The baseline study suggests there is some left occipital delta. 
Occipital delta Is seen in this record and there is a suggestion that there may be a T5 sharp 
wave. Despite problems with electrode integrity, over time the patient does appear to be a bit 
more awake with an increase in alpha frequency activity. 
HR: 102bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform activity may be under recognized in this record due to 
muscle and motion artifact If further characterization of his epileptiform activity is requested, a 
repeat study when the patient Is cooperative is suggested.
