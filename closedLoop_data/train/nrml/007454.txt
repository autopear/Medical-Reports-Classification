CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old gentleman who presented to the emergency room on October 1, 2010 with bizarre behavior, history of schizophrenia, anxiety, and atherosclerosis. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very sleepy throughout much of the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates stage 1 and stage 2 sleep through the vast majority of the record. The patient remains quite drowsy, even in photic stimulation, but on one occasion there is a brief maximal wakefulness with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm. Generous background beta is noted. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for: 
1. An individual who is excessively sleepy. 
2. Excess beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be of use.
