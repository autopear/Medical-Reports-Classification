CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old female with cardiac arrest 24 hours ago. 
MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Ativan, Dilantin, Dopamine, Klonopin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and appears to be unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern with brief bursts of cerebral activity lasting 3 to 7 seconds. Sometimes if the activity is 7 seconds in duration, it is seen with brief bursts of 5 seconds plus 2 seconds. There is a significant amount of muscle twitch artifact observed. With this markedly suppressed background the patient appears to have a rapid respiratory rate and there are head movements noted even when the EEG appears to be attenuated. An almost choreiform like movement is noted with respiration in the upper chest. Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record. 
HR: 104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a discontinuous pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern 24 hours after cardiac arrest is a worrisome prognosis with a discontinuous EEG pattern. Careful correlation with exposure to anesthetic doses or sedative hypnotic medications is suggested.
