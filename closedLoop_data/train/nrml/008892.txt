HISTORY: 68 year old right handed female presents with left sided weakness and 
seizures that are characterized by shaking of left ann. Patient has history of right CVA. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Valium, Depakote. 
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement wÂ«h 1 channel of EKG. The patient has been having frequent spells with 
spasm in the left arm and is confused. 
OF THE As the tracing begins. the patient is awake. She Is quite 
animated and has difficulty relaxing and there is a fair amount of muscle artifact in the 
background. There is a 10Hz alpha rhythm identifiable on the left in the background which is 
rich in beta and muscle artifact. There is rhythmic slowing in the right parietal region. As the 
patient starts to relax while she remains awake, focal features can be observed with disruption 
of faster frequency activity In the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere includes rhythmic 4 Hz 
to 6 Hz activity throughout much of the right hemisphere with more right frontal delta. In contrast 
at that point there is a 10 Hz alpha on the left. As the patient becomes drowsy and transitions in 
and out of drowsiness, a pattern with more rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere is seen 
intermittently. Depakote Is ordered but does not appear to have been infused during the EEG. 
No additional clinical spells are recorded during the EEG. 
HR: 96 bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity. 
2. Background slowing. 
No epileptiform features were observed.
