CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old woman with recurrent strokes, atherosclerosis, recent bypass surgery, now with twitching in the right face, arm and leg, several days following focal bypass. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Versed, ASA, Plavix. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is a relatively high amplitude study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is looking to the right. She is uncomfortable. There is a pattern of high amplitude sharply contoured activity with higher amplitude activity in the left temporal region than the right. There is a pattern of rhythmic 3-5 hertz activity in the left anterior temporal region. It is very sharply contoured. Using an average reference to manage the high amplitude discharge, there is some rhythmic activity with a left anterior temporal sharp wave and at times, the activity does seem to evolve. The patient seems to be holding her left hand on the hospital bed, head turned to the right, right arm not moving during the EEG. She is described as restless. During the EEG, the patient has no leg twitching, but some abdominal muscle twitching. On 2 or 3 occasions, there is frequency evolution in this very sharply contoured and high amplitude background. There are no well defined clinical seizures that are associated with this. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly abnormal background. 
2. Sharply contoured generous theta pattern. 
3. Likely 3 complex partial seizures, which are subtle in terms of frequency evolution. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative process in the left frontotemporal region. Additional EEG monitoring was undertaken to make certain that this pattern was addressed.
