CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old ambidextrous male with refractory status epilepticus. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Ativan, Depakote, Dilantin, Lovenox, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and 
unresponsive. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow, 
periodic complex which is essentially high amplitude, generalized. It seems to be 
prominent bilaterally in the posterior temporal regions. The periodicity of the complex is 
0.94. Stimulation of the patient has little impact on the discharge. It is a bit more 
prominent on the left. 
HR: 104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with an essentially suppressed pattern with a 
periodic complex which ranges from 0.9 to 0.78 periodicity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The patient's medications may play a role in the 
background suppression. The periodicity for this discharge can be seen in other 
significant, severe epileptic encephalopathy.
