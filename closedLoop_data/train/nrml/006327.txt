CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unknown age male, unresponsive with hypoxic ischemic injury.  EEG to rule out electrocerebral silence.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Depakote, Heparin, Pantoprazole
REASON FOR EEG:  Prognosis.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with arterial, temporal, and EKG electrodes.  The patient was comatose during the recording.   
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  Diffuse muscle artifact during the entire recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude background with diffuse intermixed muscle artifact, seen most prominently in the frontal electrodes.  There appears to be no clear reactivity or change to the pattern during the recording, this by stimulation.  No normal posterior dominant rhythm or beta frequency rhythm is seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Diffuse low amplitude slow recording with no clear electrocerebral activity seen; however, this interpretation is impeded by the marked intermixed muscle artifact seen throughout the recording. 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Lack of normal electrical activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is abnormal due to the low amplitude of recording and no clear electrocerebral activity is seen; however, no conclusions in terms of  prognosis can be assessed due to the marked muscle artifact seen throughout the recording which impedes accurate interpretation of this EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
