CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 47-year-old male with acute dysequillibrium with right thalamic hemorrhage and fever. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Midazalam, and Labetalol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, unresponsive, and the clinical notes are that his Ativan was turned off three hours prior to this EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and includes a slow to medium amplitude pattern.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry, particularly in the right temporal regions but also in the central region with primarily slow delta and less alpha and beta frequency activity in comparison to the left hemisphere.  The two hemispheres are relatively symmetric in the frontal region in terms of the quantity of alpha and beta frequency activity.  
Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  There is some degree of variability in that some sections of the record are richer in alpha and beta frequency activity than others.  
HR:  116 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a pattern primarily of delta with smaller amounts of alpha and beta frequency activity.
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity from the right central and temporal regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen.  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter involving the right hemisphere more significantly than the left.  No seizures were recorded.  The patientâ€™s medications may play role in the pattern seen today.
