INTRODUCTION RECORD: 
Routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. The patient was stimulated with tactile stimulation and was lethargic during the recording. 
CLINIC PROBLEMS: 
None. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Heparin, Ativan, and pantoprazole. 
HISTORY: 
A 51-year-old male with history of CHF, AAA resection or AAA repair, AFib., and alcohol use that presents with cardiac arrest at home on September 17, 2011, and arrived coding in the hospital, now slightly more responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to diffusely slow background characterized by frontally predominant alpha frequency discharge, which is nicely defined, and appears to wax and wane to the recording. No normal posterior abdominal rhythm and/or frontal central beta seen. No normal sleep architecture is seen. During the recording, the patient is stimulated and there is diffuse muscle artifact seen with change in the diffuse frequency about theta frequency. No normal activity seen. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
General slow waves in the alpha pattern, mildly reactive to a theta frequency. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to diffuse lower in the alpha and theta frequency. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is not specifically regards to etiology. The alpha pattern seen at the beginning of the recording, although at times can be seen as hypoxic injury in this case was reactive to stimulation, which is more likely induced by medication and rather .than an actual hypoxic injury. We would repeat the EEG recording if clinically desired.
