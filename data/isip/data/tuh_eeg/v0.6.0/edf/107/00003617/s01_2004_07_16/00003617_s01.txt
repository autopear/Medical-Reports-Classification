CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old, right-handed male who had an episode on Memorial Day.  Legs went numb.  The patient began spinning around and then had loss of consciousness, falling to the grass.  MRI demonstrated right temporal hematoma plus other areas of hemorrhage, thought to be older than the date of injury.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lisinopril, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a MU rhythm identified from the central regions, although testing is not performed. The most notable abnormality in this record is identified in wakefulness, augmented slightly in hyperventilation and includes rhythmic theta frequency activity from the right mid-temporal region.  In hyperventilation, some of this focal slowing becomes less rhythmic and slows to arrhythmic, 1.5 to 2 Hz. Brief  drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta activity.  Although the background is somewhat sharply contoured, there is no definite epileptiform activity in the region of the focal slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity and rhythmic theta and arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural abnormality affecting both gray and white matter.  No definite epileptiform features were seen.  If indicated, a follow-up study may be of use.
