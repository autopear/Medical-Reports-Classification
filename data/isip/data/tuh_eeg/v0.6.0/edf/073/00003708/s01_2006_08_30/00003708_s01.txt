CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old woman status-post hemangioma resection January 2006.  Patient is on Dilantin. Patient had one seizure ten years ago. Evaluate for discontinuation of Dilantin. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low amplitude 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  In maximal wakefulness, there is some subtle frontal slowing with mixed rhythmic theta and delta.  In addition, there is wicket activity seen from the left temporal region as the patient becomes drowsy.  In drowsiness, the focal slowing from the right frontal region becomes more persistent.  Although there is some artifact at the F4 electrode, there is also rare F4 sharp waves.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits supraharmonic driving. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Right frontal focal slowing. 
	Occasional right frontal sharp waves. 
	More subtle-appearing left frontal delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality in the right frontal region despite the history of left frontal meningioma.  The unilateral wicket may be a normal finding.
