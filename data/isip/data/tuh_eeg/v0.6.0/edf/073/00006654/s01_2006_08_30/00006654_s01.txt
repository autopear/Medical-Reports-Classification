CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male with schizophrenia, renal failure, and epilepsy admitted for syncope. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Clozaril, Depakote, Haldol, Zoloft, thiamin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed in the lab/at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There are bursts of independent, bilateral or asynchronous frontally predominant mixed rhythmic and arrhythmic delta activity.  There also appears to be a breach rhythm with accentuation of beta frequency activity in the left temporal region. There is no intake information provided, but in the context of a breach rhythm, there are a handful of what are likely discrete left mid-temporal sharp waves.   Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Intermittent asynchronous, frontally predominant generalized slowing. 
	A likely underlying breach rhythm with left temporal sharp waves in the same region.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No previous EEGs were available for comparison.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  Consideration for a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, as well as a localized mechanism for epilepsy is appropriate.
