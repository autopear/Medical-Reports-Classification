CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old male with seizures in sleep characterized by incontinence and shaking. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-organized background with a 9.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with slow rolling eye movements.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In this individual with a sleep-related seizure, additional recording may be helpful in the search for epileptiform activity.
