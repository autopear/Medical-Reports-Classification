CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old woman with right-sided weakness, slurred speech, status-post spine surgery who woke up unable to move her right side with strange speech, seizures, reflux, apnea, and obesity. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lescol, Heparin, and many others,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is quite drowsy.  In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As she becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background slowing as well as a more diffuse distribution of the beta activity and slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Intermittent LAMBDA is identified when the patient wakes up.  She is occasionally noted to snore and she drifts off to sleep.  Vertex waves and POSTS are seen in stage I sleep.  Snore arousals are identified.  
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep or capturing one of her spells would be useful. These results are similar to a previous EEG performed in 2000, which again was a normal study.
