CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old man with hearing loss and diabetes and childhood 
seizures, with recent seizure. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Aspirin. 
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG on awake study. Photic stimulation 
and hyperventilation performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is a well-organized 
posterior dominant alpha rhythm of 10-11 Hz, reaching 30 mcV. An increased activity is 
seen with higher amplitudes seen in the right central hemisphere throughout the record. 
During hyperventilation there is no stimulation of the record. During Photic stimulation 
subtle driving is seen. 
HR: 68bpm 
Normal EEG 
CLINICAL There are no definite epileptiform discharges or seizures 
recorded in this record. The findings of increased activity in the right central hemisphere 
could be due to electrode placement artifact on the breach rhythm of the .P2. The patient 
had a craniotomy procedure done before. Clinical correlation is recommended.
