CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 42-year-old male admitted for headaches, nausea, and head trauma with small subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Past medical history significant for seizure disorder, hepatitis C, alcohol and IV drug abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, morphine, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake through stage II sleep record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized. In maximal wakefulness, the dominant activity is theta frequency ranging from 4 to 6 Hz, 60 V. When the patient is sleeping, delta activity becomes dominant. There is independent sharp wave activity in the right mid-temporal area and left frontotemporal area with higher amplitudes up to 75 V.  Occasionally, vertex waves and spindles can be seen.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record. 
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow and poorly organized background.
Independent right mid-temporal and left frontotemporal sharp wave activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function involving both gray and white matter. The independent sharp activity supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The diffuse slowing and poorly organized background may be due to the fact that the patient had a traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
