INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed due to the patientâ€™s medical condition. The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: No definitive cerebral activity was identified.  Stimulation of the patient did not evoke definitive cerebral activity reaction.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	No definitive cerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive cerebral activity is detected by EEG. In the absence of a servere medical condition such as toxic or metabolic encephalopathy (i.e., drug overdose, hypothermia, sedative overdose) the EEG supports severe brain injury. If clinically indicated, a cerebral electrical silence study should be performed on this patient.
