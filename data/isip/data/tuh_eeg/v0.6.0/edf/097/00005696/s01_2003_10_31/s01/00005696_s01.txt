CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old gentleman found unresponsive with shaking of all extremities and postictal confusion, hypertension, asthma, and alcohol abuse. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and thiamin.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 10 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity and a small amount of background theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are intermittent bursts with irregular, sharply contoured theta activity of approximately 5 Hz seen in the left mid-to-posterior temporal region.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is snore artifact picked up followed by some arousals from sleep. 
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
Sharply contoured theta from the left mid-temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given that this is a bedside record without deeper stages of sleep, as well as the fact that this record was paused for two hours and the temporal features were seen after the resumption of the study, consideration for a follow-up study in the lab would be appropriate.
