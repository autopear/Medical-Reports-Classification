CLINICAL HISTORY:   21 year-old woman with epilepsy since age 6, last seizure June 6, 2008. The seizures are tonic-clonic  with loss of consciousness  and incontinence, followed by post-ictal drowsiness. They occur 10-15 times a month.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is a 7 Hertz posterior-dominant rhythm with a small amount of excess data. Bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing are observed in the background.  Hyperventilation is
performed early on in the record, clearly increasing the rhythmic slowing. Following
hyperventilation, the EEG is somewhat better organized, and a little bit more rhythmic as the patient starts to become drowsy, but the posterior-dominant rhythm remains slow. Other features of drowsiness include the emergence of beta frequency activity. Stimulation  of the patient is performed  to ensure that the patient is adequately awake, and the background remains slow. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
	HR:	78 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Rhythmic background  slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite the history of frequent seizures, no epileptiform  features were observed today. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
