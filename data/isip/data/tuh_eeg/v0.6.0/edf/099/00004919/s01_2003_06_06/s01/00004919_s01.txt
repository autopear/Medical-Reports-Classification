CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 60-year-old male with seizures, alcohol abuse, pancreatitis, and chronic subdural hematomas, non-compliant with medications.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Serax, Ativan, insulin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 20 V.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is prominent frontocentral theta and delta activity with rare shifting asymmetries.  The delta activity is slightly higher in the right frontal region than the left.  The patient demonstrates drowsiness with intermittent arousals and without sustained sleep.  
Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
An amplitude asymmetry with somewhat higher amplitude slowing from the right frontal region in comparison to the left as the patient becomes drowsy.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These results may be correlated with the patientâ€™s CT scan, as a subdural hematoma can attenuate the activity emanating from the frontal region.
