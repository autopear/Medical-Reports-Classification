CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year old with subdural empyema, postoperative day 5, status post evacuation of the hematoma and postoperative day #4 for a left craniotomy for also subdural empyema and another subdural hematoma.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Flagyl, Vancomycin, Insulin, Protonix, Codeine, Acetaminophen
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standar9 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is markedly abnormal and is comprised of rhythmic theta and some delta. Despite the present of bilateral craniotomies. There are independent sharp waves identified in the right frontal central region or left frontal region. Those on the right area a bit more prominent than the left. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an  increase in theta frequency activity and may also accentuate some of the sharp waves in the right frontal region. Additional functioning again seems to accentuate the epileptiform activity in that same area. The sharp waves seem to abate after suctioning stops. They start to build up again  later on in the record, but there are no definitive seizures.
	HR:	78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Replacement of normal background  with primarily theta frequency activity.
	2.	Right central sharp waves which at times appear in trains and seem to be accentuated by suctioning.
	3.	Independent left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports bihemispheric process as well as potential for seizures emanating from both hemispheres,  but the right hemisphere is considerably more irritated with trains of epileptiform activity coming from stimulation.
