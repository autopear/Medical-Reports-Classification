CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old male with epilepsy. Last known seizure event described as sudden onset with increased “lickiness” when hot.???????  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and asthma medicines.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with a 6.5 Hz to 8.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.   There is intermittent, arrhythmic delta seen particularly in the right posterior quadrant.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the slowing can be seen in either posterior quadrant, and is followed by the appearance of POSTS.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  
HR:  110 BPM, with occasional PVCs. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Mild background disorganization including a posterior dominant rhythm which varies in frequencies. 
Subtle, intermittent slowing in the posterior regions, right or left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Correlation with imaging may be helpful.  Additional evaluation for this patient’s PVCs may be appropriate.
