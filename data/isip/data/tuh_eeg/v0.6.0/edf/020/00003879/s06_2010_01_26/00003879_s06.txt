CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old woman with past cerebral abscess stroke, 
hydrocephalus, aphasia now with sepsis and posturing. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Vance, Cefepime, Heparin, Pantoprazole, Norep inephrine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10Â·20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed. This was a 5 hour study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. It is 
relatively low voltage and suppressed. Then.. is an asymmetry with more muscle on the 
left compared to the right. Occasional periodic complexes are observed out of the right 
hemisphere which are high amplitude with a generous field of spread. In addition, there 
are occasional left P3 sharp waves. Although there is increase in muscle and 
tremulousness, no prolonged epileptiform discharges are identified. 
HR: NIA. 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly abnormal background. 
2. Occasional periodic complexes from the right. 
3. Occasional left parietal sharps. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral 
function effecting both gray and white matter. No seizures were recorded.
