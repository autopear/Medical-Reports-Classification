CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old female presented in status post brain abscess, craniotomy. 
Please follow up. 
MEDICATIONS: Labetalol, Vancomycin, Keppra, Flagyl, Ceftriaxone, Tylenol, Acetaminophen 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrate an interhemispheric 
asymmetry. There are also shifting asymmetries. The left hemisphere is lower ve.ltage, and both 
have a fair amount of delta. The right hemisphere has more alpha and theta frequency activity in 
the posterior regions. In addition, there are occasional bursts of delta with a mixed right frontal 
sharp wave observed. The bursts of delta with right frontal sharp wave are on the order of 10 
seconds duration. Other foci of sharp waves in the right hemisphere include a C4 phase 
reversal with at times a positivity in the right mid to anterior temporal region. Features of 
drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. 
HR: 112 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Bihemispheric process with bilateral background slowing. 
2. Shifting asymmetries with, in fact, a bit more faster frequency activity in the left occipital 
region than the left. 
3. Sharp waves in the right hemisphere, some of which are frontal but some of which are right 
central in nature. These occurs in bursts. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. Comparison with previous EEGs, not 
available at this time, may be useful.
