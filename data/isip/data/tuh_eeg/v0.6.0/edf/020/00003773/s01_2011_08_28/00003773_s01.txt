REASON FOR STUDY: 
Seizures. 
INTRODUCTION: 
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with EKG electrodes and anterior temporal electrode. The patient was awake during the recording and photic stimulation was performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Keppra. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
There was excessive muscle artifact over the anterior temporal electrodes bilaterally. 
HISTORY: 
This is a 61 year-old woman presents with history of altered mental status and past medical history of end-stage renal disease, anemia, osteopenia, DVT/PE, and seizures for 11 years. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
Posterior dominant rhythm at 8.5 to 9Hz and 20 to 65 microvolts amplitude can be seen, which react symmetrically to eye opening as well as an increased amount of theta in the frontal and central regions, 15 Hz to 25Hz and 13 to 15 microvolts amplitude is also seen. No sleep is captured and photic stimulation reveals a normal response. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
The recording reveals generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude seen during wakefulness. Please note that the muscle artifact described above limits the interpretation of the record. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal awake EEG due to mild diffuse slow waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This limited awake EEG is consistent with mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures were seen.
