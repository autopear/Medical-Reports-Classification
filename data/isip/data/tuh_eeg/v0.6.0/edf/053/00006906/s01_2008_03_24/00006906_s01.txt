CLINICAL HISTORY:   68-year-old gentleman with a temperature of 102, who is being evaluated for pulmonary mass.  After a VATS procedure, he became unresponsive  and had a PEA code on March 3, 2008, at 4:45 p.m. for two hours.  Evaluate for jerky movements.  The EEG was performed at 10 a.m. on March 4, 2008.
MEDICATIONS:   Dopamine, Norepinephrine,  Keppra, Baclofen, Nexium, Heparin, Vasopressin, Phenylephrine, Ativan, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient is comatose, intubated but is stimulated on multiple occasions during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There is continuous rhythmic 6-9 Hz activity in the frontocentral regions relatively symmetric. The temporal regions are markedly suppressed bilaterally.  Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  There is no significant variability or reactivity observed. There is some very slow head rocking activity at the T6 02 electrode.
	HR: 	102 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Replacement  of normal background with frontal, rhythmic, alpha/theta frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This could be considered a form of alpha  which is rare, but carries a relatively unfavorable prognosis approximately 18 hours post cardiac arrest.  If there are other clinical concerns, a repeat tracing may be of use.  No myoclonus and no seizures were observed during this record.
