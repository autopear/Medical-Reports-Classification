CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year old male with history of a gunshot wound to the head 
with VP shunt and multiple seizures at home. The patient had a prior craniotomy. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Valium. Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed al bedside using standard 10-20 
electrode placement. The patient is also intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is slow with mostly delta 
but also theta pattern. There is no appreciable postdominant rhythm. As the record 
begins, generous beta is seen ln the frontal regions, specialty the left frontal region 
consistent with a breach rhythm. As the record continues, the appearance of a right 
central breach rhythm is also seen. Head rolling artifact is seen in the posterior 
regions. 
HR: 120bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. One period of slowing of the background, mostly of the delta range. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen in his record. The 
slowness of the background is nonspecific and consistent with diffuse dysfunction of 
cerebral function. The breach rhythm on left .is consistent with a left skull defect with 
question of a possible defect in the right central region.
