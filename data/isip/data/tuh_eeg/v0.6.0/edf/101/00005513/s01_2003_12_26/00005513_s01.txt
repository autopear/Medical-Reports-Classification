CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old male with CNS toxo, HIV infection, spasmodic movements of the left side, no history of seizures, admitted in September with re-enhancing lesions.
MEDICATIONS: Multiple HIV medications, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Neurontin, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is essentially an asleep record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is brief wakefulness with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, and in wakefulness there is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic theta from the right frontocentral region.  In drowsiness and occasionally in sleep, there is a left frontocentral sharp and slow wave complex and some involvement to the midline.  This may be discrete or higher amplitude on one or two occasions.  There is an after going slow wave that follows this.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving at various flash frequencies.  
HR:  80 to 90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in sleep due to:
Subtle focal slowing with rhythmic frontal delta/theta awake and rare left frontocentral sharp waves.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Arrhythmic slowing is contralateral to the patientâ€™s spasticity.  The sharp waves are ipsilateral to his motor complaint.  Correlation with imaging and clinical history may be helpful to put this back into appropriate context.
