CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old male with alcohol abuse, epilepsy, stroke in 1997, and cardiomyopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Heparin, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the record is drowsy with a mixture of theta and beta frequency activity.  In this state, there is rare, subtle left frontotemporal slowing.  Sometimes this is picked up bilaterally in the frontal regions.  On occasion, this is associated with a discrete, left frontotemporal sharp wave maximum at F7 and T1, sometimes appearing as a couplet.  Features of deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  As the patient reaches stage II sleep, the EEG becomes more symmetric and more synchronous.  There are rare left anterior temporal sharp waves in stage II sleep.  These discrete discharges persist throughout the light sleep record.  In maximal wakefulness, the patient arouses and the EEG becomes well organized, symmetric with a low voltage, symmetric reactive 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of frontocentral beta activity. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontotemporal sharp and slow wave or discrete spike and slow wave activity.
Subtle left frontotemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  Correlation with this patient’s imaging may be valuable.
