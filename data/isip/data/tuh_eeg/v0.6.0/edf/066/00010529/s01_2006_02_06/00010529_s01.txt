CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old male with HTN, DM, CHF, hepatitis C, and MI admitted with episodic left face and arm shaking in sleep.  Evaluate for epilepsy partialis continua.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow background with an alpha rhythm ranging from 7 to 8.5 Hz, 30 uV.  There are intermittent asymmetries with some sharply contoured theta, sharply contoured delta, and a handful of sharp waves from the left centrotemporal region.  There is no mention that the patient is twitching during the EEG.  The video is reviewed and no twitching is seen.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.   Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing, as well as the focal slowing described above. 
HR:  72 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Occasional focal slowing on the left with associated temporal sharp waves. 
	Mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left and raises the possibility of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
