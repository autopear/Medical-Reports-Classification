	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard
1020 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with a 7.5 to 8 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background delta.
	Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation activate the record. HR: 	70 BPM.
	IMPR ESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified in this record. 	These features are nonspecific and can be seen in an underlying toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
