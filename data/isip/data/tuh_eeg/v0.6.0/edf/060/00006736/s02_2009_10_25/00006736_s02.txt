CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 83-year-old woman with intermittent episodes of confusion, stuttering.  Left subdural hematoma.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-
20 system of electrode placement. Patient is awake and conversant.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. At some points, there is a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 9 Hz, at other times significantly slower. There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with intermittent bursts of focal slowing from the left hemisphere,  particularly frontocentral temporal region with some sharply contoured activity left frontocentral and left temporal. In addition, there are bursts of bilateral arrhythmic delta activity and bursts of shifting slowing. Some sections of the awake record demonstrate a slow background.
Brief sleep with vertex waves and spindles are seen but are not sustained. Heart rate 96 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
	2.	Disorganization.
	3. 	lntrahemispheric asymmetry.
	4.	Occasional sharply contoured slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded. The intermittent back ground slowing and the generalized slowing is more compatible with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or diffuse process. In comparison to the first study, no seizures were
recorded.
