CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 32-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, last tonic-clonic seizure in 1999, now with left arm numbness.
MEDICATIONS: Topiramate.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The overall organization of the EEG is at the limits of what one might expect for an adult with just a scant degree of disorganization and background theta.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record.  Hyperventilation elicits a handful of bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta.  In addition, on two occasions, the bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant delta are preceded by focal, sharply contoured mixed delta and theta from the left hemisphere, particularly in the frontotemporal regions. Hyperventilation is performed as the patient becomes drowsy and bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontal delta are noted.   In some of these bursts, there is a suspicious, underlying sharp wave at F3.  Additional sleep recording identifies similar bursts of high amplitude delta, but on one occasion with a burst of slowing with an underlying, right frontal sharp wave.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
An unusual pattern in hyperventilation with bursts of sharply contoured focal slowing from the left frontal region prior to a more generalized pattern of slowing.
Underlying, independent, right or left frontal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Consideration for a localization-related mechanism for this patientâ€™s epilepsy is appropriate.  The majority of the abnormalities are in the frontal region, close to the midline.  This EEG may represent a single, unilateral left frontal focus, or a process involving both frontal regions.  It would be a somewhat more unusual presentation for a primary generalized epilepsy because of the focal features seen prior to the generalized bursts.  No seizures were recorded, and no previous EEGs were available for comparison.
