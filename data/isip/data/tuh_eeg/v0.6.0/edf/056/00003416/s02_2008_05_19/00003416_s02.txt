CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year-old male with continuous right facial twitching, large left 
MCA stroke, aphasia, confusion. Evaluate for active facial twitching today. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lasix, Aspirin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no video, no technical description 
as to whether or not this is done in the lab or at the bedside. In addition, there is 
obvious twitch artifact in the right face, but there is little in the way of technologist's 
comments. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens the background is somewhat 
slow. There is continuous, 6-7 Hz muscle twitch artifact observed in the right scalp 
electrode. There is no definitive epileptiform activity observed on the left to correlate 
with this. The activity can be re-reviewed with other montages including average 
reference but is not helpful. The circle montage is the best in terms of delineating 
activity. With the circle montage, the twitch artifact is quite localized to the right frontal 
and frontotemporal scalp electrodes. When the twitch is apparently stopped, the 
background demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry particularly in the left frontal 
and frontotemporal regions with disruption of arpha and theta frequency activities on the 
left. The right hemisphere demonstrates only mild degree of slowing. There is a 7.5 Hz 
alpha rhythm, more so on the right than on the left. The video of this patient is of the left 
side of the head, so it is very difficult to see the right facial twitching although at times 
that can be discerned when the camera is re-angled. Some portions of the record with 
facial twitching demonstrate less in the way of focal slowing than others. Most of the 
twitching is facial. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to 
1. Mild slowing from the right. 
2. lntrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
