HISTORY: 59-year-old woman with complex partial seizures, last seizure 3 months ago. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and fairly well organized for age.  There is a 10 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is well attenuated with eyes opened. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Soon after the beginning of this recording, wicket activity is seen in the left anterior temporal area.  In drowsiness, occasional sharp activity is also observed in the temporal area with intermittent focal slowing. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved. 
Photic stimulation elicits driving.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Occasional left anterior quadrant sharp activity with intermittent focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal findings in this supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient. Wicket activity is a normal variant, however, it was only seen in the left anterior temporal area, which is an unusual finding. Correlation with neuroimaging studies is suggested.
