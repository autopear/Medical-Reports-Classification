CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right-handed woman with MRI of brain and C-spine suggestive of multiple sclerosis with multiple, white matter changes in brain and spinal cord as well as some cervical DJD. History of vertigo. 
MEDICATIONS: Claritin, Flonase, Gabapentin, Singulair 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The overall background is sharply contoured. There is temporal wicket, but despite this, there is both some arrhythmic delta in the left temporal region and a handful of left temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include background slowing with vertex waves, spills, and POSTS in stage 2 sleep. There is some shifting asymmetries noted primarily in wakefulness and hyperventilation, but in stage 2 sleep, there is a little bit of left or right, slowing perhaps a bit more so in the left temporal region and posterior temporal region in the right. Hyperventilation produces a synchronous slowing as described above. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Occasional bursts of asynchronous slowing. 
2. Occasional left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to the October 1, 2008 record, there is a little bit less in the wave arrhythmic delta activity. No seizures were recorded. The occasional bursts of focal slowing may be related to the underlying diagnosis of a white matter disorder.
