CLINICAL HISTORY: 63-year-old with Parkinson disease, agitation, paralysis and 
encephalopathy. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Sinemet, Zosyn, Lovenox, Metoprolol, Famotidine, 
Lorazepam, Vancomycin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as having 
chewing movements and in voluntary movements of the left arm. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is awake. There 
is a pattern of rhythmic theta with muscle. The muscle artifact is so significant that at 
time, it nearly obscures the EEG. Spastic tremulous arm movements are observed 
during the baseline EEG and are not associated with a change in the slow record, but 
do produce motor artifact. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
CORRELATION: If left arm movement and chewing movements are thought 
to be epileptiform for this individual, no EEG signature was seen for these. The 
moderate background slowing with a theta pattern and bursts of delta supports a severe 
underlying encephalopathy as could be seen in a severe disturbance of cerebral 
function effecting both gray and white matter.
