CLINICAL HISTORY: 63-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease, advanced dementia, an 
episode of a focal seizure requiring 6 mg of Ativan over 30 minutes as well as Dilantin load. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Sinemet, Zosyn, Lovenox, Metoprolol, Famotidine, Lorazepam, 
Vancomycin 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside using standard 
10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD As the tracing begins, the patient demonstrates some 
tremor artifact. The patient is intermittently mobile, demonstrating a spastic left arm. Of note, the 
camera is on the left side and the right arm is more difficult to visualize. Features of sleep 
include an increase in beta. This EEG is divided into two pieces. The first begins at 1300 hours 
and concludes at 14:24 hours. The date of this study was April 2, 2008 to April 3, 2008. The 
second episodes concludes at 14:29. Patient is relatively somnolent. The overall background is 
slow with beta and at times discontinuity. Intermittent rhythmic movement artifact is picked up 
and obscures the EKG. One example of this is seen at 20:00. The sleep recording overnight 
demonstrates an increase in background delta. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: This 24 hour long term video EEG monitoring is remarkable for: 1. Marked 
background slowing; 2. Intermittent muscle artifact which produces rhythmic beta artifact; 3. No 
epileptiform features. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance of 
cerebral function. No epileptiform features were seen.
