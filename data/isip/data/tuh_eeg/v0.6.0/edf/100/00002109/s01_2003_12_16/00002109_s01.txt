CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 70-year-old male with an AVM repair, right-sided skull defect, left hemiparesis, now with an episode in August of shaking with unresponsiveness and postictal confusion for an hour.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, aspirin, Protonix, antibiotics.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient with frequent chewing motion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta frequency pattern.  While there is prominent muscle on the right, underlying the muscle there is a breach rhythm, as well as bursts of occasional sharply contoured delta maximum in the right mid-temporal region.  Despite the artifacts seen, there are rare sharp waves identified with a field in the right anterior temporal region.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing. 
Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Focal slowing with sharply contoured delta activity on the right.
Sharp waves as described above despite the limitations outlined.  
	
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function as well as a structural or functional abnormality on the right.  A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy and may account for the high amplitude of the rare epileptiform activity described above.
