CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 57-year-old woman with new onset aphasia, loss of consciousness, bilateral strokes, hypertension, and seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Heparin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as lethargic. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG is abnormal.  There is rhythmic 1 to 2 Hz delta activity identified particularly in the frontal regions, perhaps slower on the right than the left.  There is a smaller amount of theta frequency activity, which demonstrates some shifting asymmetries, but seems to be more vigorous on the left compared to the right.  There are high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes identified from the right hemisphere, with a maximum in the anterior temporal region. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Profound background slowing, right greater than left.
High amplitude right temporal spike and slow wave discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter, perhaps effecting the right hemisphere more significantly than the left.  A partial mechanism for epilepsy should be considered.
