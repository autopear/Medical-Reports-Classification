CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old male with post-traumatic epilepsy, subsequent stroke, now with breakthrough seizures.  Patient confused for a prolonged period of time afterwards. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, aspirin, and other medications. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake and cooperative throughout the record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There is subtle, intermittent focal slowing identified from the left frontal temporal region.  At times this includes rhythmic activity of 3 to 5 Hz.  On other occasions, there seems to be intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity in this region.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, there are occasional sharp waves identified maximum at FP1 or occasionally isoelectric at FP1/F3.  On occasion, these may be maximum in the left anterior temporal electrode.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and subtly accentuates some of the focal slowing in the frontotemporal/frontocentral regions.  
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at 15 Hz, but the left anterior temporal sharp waves seem to be accentuated by lower frequency stimulation.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves with some variability; some of the epileptiform discharges are maximum in the left frontal region.
Intermittent focal slowing from the left, accentuated by hyperventilation.
?Accentuated focal epileptiform activity seen in photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are similar to a previous study dated 5/17/02.  When the epileptiform activity is more prominent in this record, photic stimulation also appeared to accentuate this pattern.  This may be due to the proximity of this recording to this patientâ€™s postictal state.
