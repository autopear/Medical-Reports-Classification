CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 56-year-old male with depression, epilepsy since age 13; last seizure age 27.  Patient has facial tics, funny smells, loss of awareness, and patient reported visual hallucinosis during the EEG in the absence of photic stimulation.  
MEDICATIONS: Prozac.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness, there is somewhat irregular temporal 3.5 to 5 Hz activity.  This relaxed wakefulness, early drowsy state is followed by hyperventilation early on in the record and there is some initial shifting, right or left temporal theta.  In addition, there are discrete right anterior temporal sharp waves, which occasionally occur as triplets.  These may be seen in the setting of right or left temporal slowing, and there are rare left temporal sharp waves. 
Brief stage I sleep is characterized by vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent, shifting irregular temporal theta.
Subtle, independent right greater than left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a localization-related mechanism for this individualâ€™s seizures.  Although the patient reported flashing lights during the EEG, no seizures were recorded.
