CLINICAL HISTORY:   72-year-old woman admitted on February 14, 2008 with a right frontal intercerebral hemorrhage requiring left ventriculostomy.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:   Digital EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is described as intubated and unresponsive with tremulousness  of 1 hand.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates  a slow pattern with rhythmic theta and shifting arrhythmic delta activity. There is greater delta on the right compared to the left. Episode of shaking hand and tremor are associated muscle artifact
, but no ictal pattern. In addition, there is more muscle on the right than on the left compatible with what might have been a hemiparesis.
	HR: 	66 to 80 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG  due to:
	1. 	Marked background  slowing.
	2. 	Shifting arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
No epileptiform features were seen. The bilateral
background slowing and shifting arrhythmic delta activities supported by hemispheric disorder. There is more slowing on the right. congruent with a history of hemorrhage.
