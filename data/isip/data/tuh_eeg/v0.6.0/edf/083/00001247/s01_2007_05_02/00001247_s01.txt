CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old male with epilepsy and a previous stroke with alcohol and smoking history. Patient admitted on 3/31/07 following a seizure while going up the stairs with an elevated Dilantin level.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Nexium, ?Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was perfom1ed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized.   There is 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is some occipitally predominant occasional slowing particularly in the right occipitotemporal regions with a handful of right occipitotemporal sharp waves.   Features of drowsiness include  an  increase  in  background  slowing  with  some  hypersynchronous slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:  84 BPM.
IM   PRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1.  Background disorganization.
2.  Right greater than left occipitotemporal slowing with rare sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlation with imaging. Consideration for a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, as well as a posterior process is appropriate.   In that the individual did suffer recent head trauma, a follow-up study may be of some use.
