CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 70-year-old male found in the street for an unknown time with bradycardia and hypothermia.  Evaluate for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, magnesium, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  The patient is sometimes somnolent, sometimes somewhat agitated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is awake, the background EEG includes a fair amount of muscle, but is diffusely slow primarily with a mixture of theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the muscle drops out and the mixture is primarily theta with slow rolling eye movements and delta.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Replacement of normal background with primarily a theta pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These features are non-specific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study when the patient is more alert may be valuable.
