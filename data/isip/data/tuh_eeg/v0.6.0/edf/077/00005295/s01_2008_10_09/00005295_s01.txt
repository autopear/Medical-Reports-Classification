CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year-old female who was admitted with status epilepticus . The patient had past medical history of seizures since 2005, and left hemispheric cyst.MEDICATIONS :  Topamax, Dilantin, Ativan, Valium.INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Tactile stimulation was applied.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background is of low voltage recording with bihemispheric slowing. There was excess beta activity from both hemispheres. The first half of the recording	howed an increase in movement artifact. Towards the end of the recording the muscle artifact decreases and intermittent , rare rhythmic theta activity is seen in left hemisphere . No epileptiform activity or continuous seizures were noted during the recording.HR:	120 bpmIMPRESSION :  Abnormal EEG due to:1. Bi-hemispheric slowing2. Excess beta activity.3. Rare rhythmic theta activity in the left hemisphereCLINICAL CORRELATION : This EEG recording supports pharmacologic pattern, with excess beta activity from a benzodiazepine affect. No epileptiform activity was noted in this recording. Left temporal theta is in region of CNS Cy st.
