CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old male found down after trauma.  Status-post craniotomy for subdural hematoma evacuation. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vancomycin, Flagyl, and morphine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and comatose. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow, with slower activity out of the left versus the right, as well as a breach rhythm on the right.   As the recording continues, there is less arrhythmic delta and a little bit more beta and theta particularly in the region of the breach. Stimulation is performed around this time, and does not clearly activate the record.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Generalized marked background slowing.
	Slightly slower activity on the left.
	A breach rhythm seen on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG demonstrates a bilateral disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The asymmetry of the background may be due to the craniotomy performed on the right.
