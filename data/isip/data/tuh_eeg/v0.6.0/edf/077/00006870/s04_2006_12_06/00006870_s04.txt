CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old male with episodes of body shaking without loss of consciousness.  History of alcohol abuse and seizures.    
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vecuronium, Nexium, Versed, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was reevaluated for tremor of the right arm. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and delta.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with a breach rhythm noted on the right.  The patient is stimulated during the EEG, and the stimulation does seem to produce an alteration in the background.  The right arm tremor is associated with some movement artifact.  The technologist is able to hold up the arm to demonstrate the tremor.  Of note, the patient also has some body tremulousness during the EEG, again without epileptiform activity or other EEG correlates.  The right arm movement actually produces muscle artifact, identifiable in the EKG lead.  Also noted on the video is that the left arm actually moves and has some tremulousness from side to side.  Stimulation of the patient produces some generalized arrhythmic delta and then some theta.   
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Generalized background slowing.
	Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were seen.
