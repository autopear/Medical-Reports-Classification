CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 26-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy status-post left frontal resection now with abrupt cluster of focal seizures characterized by head turning to the right and right arm jerking.   
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Klonopin, Valium, Lamictal, Ativan, Oxcarbazepine, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the neurological ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This patient has multiple clinical events during the EEG and is able to push the button for most of the events.  Seizures are characterized by a great deal of muscle artifact and are challenging in terms of localization.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial hours of the recording, the seizures occur as often as one every five minutes, and are associated with focal twitching of the right hand and some but not all are associated with uncomfortable turning of the head to the right and the face to the right.  Typical duration for the spells is 15 seconds, and they occur as often as one every three minutes in the initial portions of the record, slowing over time.  In the initial 24-hours of the record, the patient receives large quantities of benzodiazepines.  In the later sections of the record, she starts sleeping, holding the seizure alarm, making it more difficult to quantitate seizures.  In the initial section, they average about one every four minutes.  The recording terminates at 23:06 and then restarts a few minutes afterwards.  The seizures start to slow down at 4:00 AM with only three in the hour at 4:00 AM, five in the hour at 5:00 AM, and then picking back up at 7:00 or 8:00 AM. 
HR:  115 BPM.
Long-Term EEG Monitoring, October 27, 2006 to October 28, 2006
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the neurological ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. In addition to the previously described medications, the patient receives 1 gram of Solumedrol.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Frequent simple partial seizures lasting 10 to 15 seconds without clear scalp correlates are noted in the daytime hours, slowing in the afternoon to less than five per hour, and then again slowing overnight to less than five events per hour.  The EEG is primarily a pattern of fast activity without a well-defined alpha rhythm.  All of the seizures are difficult to localize by scalp EEG, but do have characteristic tonic-clonic artifact at the end.  The events with prolonged shaking of the right hand, which is mild, low amplitude and not causing discomfort to the patient are primarily characterized by movement artifact and muscle; however, unfortunately, it is not possible to see the EEG.  It is almost impossible to really identify an EEG correlate due to the great deal of muscle. 
Long-Term EEG Monitoring, October 28, 2006 to October 29, 2006
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the neurological ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During this section of the record, the patient has gradual slowing of simple partial seizures.  The push button events have slowed considerably, and it appears that the patient is not using the push button log.  The background EEG at this time includes a great deal of muscle and motion artifact.  By the afternoon on the 28th, the electrode integrity has been lost.  
	INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this section of the record appears to show slowing of the overall seizure frequency, however, much of the data is uninterpretable. 
	
Long-Term EEG Monitoring, October 29, 2006 to October 30, 2006
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the neurological ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Klonopin, Valium, Lamictal, Ativan, Oxcarbazepine, and Phenytoin.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During this section of the record, the patient complains of painful twitching of the right arm.  The initial section of the record includes a great deal of artifact.  Later sections of the record include a sleep pattern with generous fast activity, with focal slowing from the left frontal region.  There is a clear breach rhythm identified.  This section of the record shows much more extensive periods with sleep for this individual and despite problems with the eventual appearance of loss of electrode integrity, the available data shows a clear improvement with a decrease in seizures.  
	
Long-Term EEG Monitoring, October 30, 2006
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Klonopin, Valium, Lamictal, Ativan, Oxcarbazepine, Dilantin, and Phenytoin.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In this six-hour section, the patient does not push the button for seizures.  There is a background with generous fast activity and some left frontal, intermittent delta.  There is a relative paucity of epileptiform activity.  The sleep record is characterized by sleep morphologies and an increase in beta with a breach rhythm from the left.   
HR: 115 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Long-term EEG monitoring for this individual with refractory simple partial seizures was remarkable for:
	Multiple simple partial seizures without a clear scalp correlate, although the motor activity was classic for epileptiform discharges. There was ongoing improvement in the epileptiform activity over time, compatible with resolution of this process.
