HISTORY: 61 year old male admitted to the ICU with confusion and combative behavior after a tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at.bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a low to medium amplitude, continuous pattern, rich in beta and theta frequency activity. There was a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm. The posterior dominant rhythm is 7-8 Hz. There is some background theta of approximately 5 Hz in the posterior regions. Occasional bursts of FIRDA are observed. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity.
	HR:	96  bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  If further characterization of this individual with epilepsy is important, a repeat tracing in capturing sleep and more sustained wakefulness is advised.
