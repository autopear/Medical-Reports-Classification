CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old woman with myxedema coma and bilateral changes in the MRI, persistent coma with twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Moxifloxacin, Dilantin, Keppra, Vancomycin, Hydrocortisone, Levothyroxine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and is stimulated during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous but slow pattern.  There is vertex-like activity observed with shifting asymmetries, but a little bit more prominent on the right with sharply-contoured  delta.  The overall background is one of rhythmic theta and delta.  The amplitude is now within normal limits.  The central, vertex sharp waves, which are typically CZ/C4, persist.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an increase in theta, but the sharp waves are again noted in that same region.   The sharp waves are prominent but do not evolve.
	HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Central and midline sharp waves with maximum typically just to the right of the midline.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The overall background is improving compared to previous studies.  No clinical or electrographic  seizures were identified today.
