CLINICAL HISTORY: S9 year old gentleman with refractory epilepsy, right hemiparesis, breakthrough seizures, chronic static encephalopathy , elevated serum ammonia, loose stools and with a Oepakote level of SO. The date of his most seizure is not known. Reported breakthrough seizures but data unknown. Bilateral temporal encephalomalacia and left temporal encephalomalacia.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intra-hemispheric asymmetry with a primarily 8 Hz activity on the right in wakefulness and a slower activity on the left with more attenuated activity on the left. In addition, sharp waves are observed on the left including F7 and TS. The most prominent focus of epileptiform activity is at TS with low voltage , somewhat periodic sharp waves observed at TS. As the patient transitions into sleep, the epileptiform activity persists including F7, F1 and these relatively frequent low voltage TS sharp waves. There are also a handful of sharp waves in the transition to sleep on the right at C4.
Intermittent arousals to and from sleep are observed. In the transition to sleep, there are even some sharp waves observed at 01. Photic stimulation: Photic stimulation elicits asymmetric driving, better developed on the right.
	HR:	66  bpm
IMPRESSION : Abnormal EEG due to:
	Focal sharp waves from the left hemisphere with variable maximum including anterior temporal, posterior temporal, left occipital and left frontal.
	Mild background slowing on the right.
	Rare sharp waves from the right central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous studies, no seizures were recorded today. This is the best organized EEG for this patient in a long time with fewer sharp waves than identified in the many previous EEGs recorded.
