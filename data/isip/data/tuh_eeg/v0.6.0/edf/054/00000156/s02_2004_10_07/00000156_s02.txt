CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 11-year-old male with generalized tonic-clonic seizures with change in mental status in the setting of a temperature of 102.  Dilantin level was 3.0.  
MEDICATIONS: Ativan and Haloperidol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is mainly a drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is mild excessive beta and theta frequency seen.  Arousal response was positive.  Sleep spindles, K complexes, and spontaneous high amplitude vertex waves were also prominent.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.  
HR:  102 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive drowsiness.  
Excess beta and theta activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The findings in this tracing are non-specific.  The patientâ€™s drowsiness is a major concern. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing when the patient is more alert would be of use.
