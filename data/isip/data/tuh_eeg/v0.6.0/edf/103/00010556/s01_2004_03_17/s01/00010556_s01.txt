CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 68-year-old woman with an anoxic/hypoglycemic episode in the field, acute renal failure, prior left MCA stroke with chronic hemiparesis and aphasia, now persistently unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS: Valproate, Vancomycin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is unresponsive with occasional eye movement or facial grimacing and unilateral deviation of the right eye (left eye prosthetic).  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The activity from the left hemisphere is relatively suppressed with occasional left mid-to-posterior temporal sharp waves.  The right hemisphere demonstrates essentially a theta pattern.  There are occasional frontal sharp waves, left greater than right, some of which have a periodic nature to them.  Stimulation of the patient does not significantly active the record.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intrahemispheric asymmetry, slower on the left than the right.
Left mid-temporal sharp waves. 
Right frontal or bilateral periodic complexes. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  Processes involving each hemisphere should be considered.  Correlation with follow-up neuroimaging may be helpful.  No seizures were recorded.
