CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old male found unresponsive at the bottom of a stairwell with right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and left epidural hematoma. 
MEDICATIONS: Haldol, Dilantin, Decadron, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is poorly responsive.  The background EEG is comprised of slow, 0.75 to 2 Hz delta activity with superimposed faster frequency, low voltage theta frequency activity.  There are bursts of frontally predominant arrhythmic delta activity.  There are also occasional asymmetries and at times arrhythmic delta activity is slower on the right and on rare occasions slower on the left.  There is some degree of variability in the record with some portions of the record showing more theta than others.  There is also spontaneous movement and arousal.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in background theta. 
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing with loss of faster frequency activity.
Shifting asymmetries but with slower, arrhythmic delta activity from the right central region.
Occasional FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific but support a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting the gray and white matter of each hemisphere.  Contributing factors can include the trauma described above.  These features may also be seen in a toxic or metabolic state.  No seizures or epileptiform features were seen.
