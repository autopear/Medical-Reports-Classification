DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a well formed posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz, with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is frequent eye blink artifact.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  
HR:  __ BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
