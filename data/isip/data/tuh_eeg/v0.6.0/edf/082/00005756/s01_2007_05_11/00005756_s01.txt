CLINICAL  IDSTORY:  This  is a 70-year-old male with previous  craniotomy, stroke, multiple bun  holes  (left or right??)  including  the right  frontocentral  region.  History  of  some  form  of hypertrophy brain, CAD, hyperlipidemia,  epilepsy,  but seizure free since the summer of 2006
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, Klonopin, Ativan, Dilantin, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode  placement with  one channel  of EKG. Photic stimulation   was perfom1ed.   This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness,  the background  EEG is appropriately organized with a 9 Hz posterior  dominant rhythm. In wakefulness  and into stage II sleep, there is intem1ittent  arrhythmic delta typically seen  in brief bursts lasting  less than  nvo seconds  with a mixture  of rhythmic  theta and delta.  There is also a breach rhythm  with accentuation of faster frequency  activity  in that same area. As the patient  becomes drowsy, the bursts  of focal slowing become more sharply  contoured and more prolonged.   Spindles and vertex waves are identified in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR.: 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnom1al EEG due to:
1.  Left frontotemporal/frontocentral sharply  contoured slowing.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: This EEG supports  a structural  or functional  abnom1a1ity on the left.  With the focal slowing, a potentially  epileptogenic nature is suspected.  T11e beta asymmetry is part of the breach rhytlm1 phenomenon.
