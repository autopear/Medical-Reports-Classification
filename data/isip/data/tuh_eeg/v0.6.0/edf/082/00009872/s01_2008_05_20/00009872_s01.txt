CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year-old woman with dementia, previous stroke, spastic left hemiparesis, with multiple episodes of generalized shaking, status post multiple doses of Ativan and Dilantin, now obtunded with spontaneous eye opening, moaning, but no interaction. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates an intermittently 
discontinuous pattern with an overall suppressed pattern, followed by a mixture of irregular theta and delta. Stimulation of the patient produces a more continuous pattern with more irregular theta and delta. The overall background is relatively low voltage and featureless. Muscle artifact is picked up on the left. Despite the muscle artifact, there is 
a suggestion of a sharp wave in the left central region including MC3,P3. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly slow background, at times in discontinuous pattern. 
2. Occasional left central sharp wave. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this elderly, fragile adult, the burst suppression pattern may be part of a chronic encephalopathy and accentuated by use of medications and status epilepticus. No clinical seizures were observed.
