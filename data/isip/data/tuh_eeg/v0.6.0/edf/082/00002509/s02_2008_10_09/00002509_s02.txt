CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year-old woman with active cocaine abuse, DVT, PE, staph 
infections, endocarditis, splenectomy, asthma, and cocaine abuse, transferred to the 
emergency room for hemodialysis after seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Atenolol, Coumadin, Lisinopril, ASA 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an acutely post-ictal EEG 
performed at 15:36 on 06/03/2008. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the EEG is 
remarkable for prominent slowing in the temporal regions bilaterally with prominent fast 
activity in the central regions. Over time a more characteristic pattern with central 
spindle activity is seen, and the temporal regions are richer in theta, a little richer in 
faster frequency activity, but this asymmetry between central and temporal regions is 
prominent until 20 minutes into the recording when the technologist stimulates the 
patient towards the close of the record, at which point the patient awakens and the 
asymmetric is not quite so prominent. 
HR: 96 bpm, irregular 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent slowing, particularly in the temporal regions in the initial sections of the 
record. 
2. More of a pattern of beta and generalized slowing at the close of the record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today. These 
findings should be compared with previous studies.
