CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 62-year-old woman with anoxic insult 5/4/04 with anoxic encephalopathy, status epilepticus. She remains in coma, but off Versed.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dilantin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is comatose and intubated.  There are no myoclonic movements identified.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, suppressed, and subtly discontinuous.  There is a small, discrete spike or sharp at C4 with some spread in the right hemisphere.  The discontinuity is most prominent in the central regions, and when the record is continuous, there is low voltage delta and theta.  Stimulation of the patient produces an electrodecrimental response, which on one occasion was followed by periodicity. 
HR:  90 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a discontinuous, low voltage and suppressed pattern. 
Electrodecrimental response to stimuli.
Focal epileptiform activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Compared to previous studies, this EEG represents an improvement in that the patient is no longer in status epilepticus.  However, it remains supportive of a severe anoxic injury.
