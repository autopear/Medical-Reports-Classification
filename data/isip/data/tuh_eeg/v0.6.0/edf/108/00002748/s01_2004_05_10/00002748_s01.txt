CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 25-year-old male with seizure disorder and migraines.
MEDICATIONS: Imitrex and Dilantin.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and well organized for age.  There is a 10 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eyes opened.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation mildly increased the slow wave of theta activity in the background.  Drowsiness is evidenced by a mixed frequency of activity as well as vertex waves and POSTS.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation elicits driving.  There is head rocking artifact at the T3 and T5 leads.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  POSTS are a normal variant.
