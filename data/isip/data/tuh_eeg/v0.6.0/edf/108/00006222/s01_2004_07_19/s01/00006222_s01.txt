CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 63-year-old male with new onset seizures.  History of hypertension, COPD, alcohol and Oxycontin abuse. 
MEDICATIONS: Antihypertensives, Dilantin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous, symmetric, and mildly disorganized.  There is a 7 to 8 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Intermittent generalized slowing of theta activity at 5 to 7 Hz is seen.  Occasional shifting bursts of theta/delta were seen.  No definite sharp activity is seen.  Sleep is evidenced by a decrease in the amplitude and a mixed frequency pattern.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Mildly disorganized background with intermittent generalized slowing.
Occasional shifting slowing.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a mild cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  This is non-specific.  However, no epileptiform features were identified in this record. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or sleep deprivation prior to the EEG may be helpful.
