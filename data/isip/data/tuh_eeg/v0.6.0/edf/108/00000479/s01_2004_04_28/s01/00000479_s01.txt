CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 60-year-old male admitted for change in mental status.  History of seizure disorder, diabetes, chronic renal failure, stroke, and aphasia. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the majority of the background EEG demonstrates muscle movement artifact. When the artifact subsides, the background EEG is low voltage with excessive theta activity, as well as a slight excess of beta activity.  No focal features or epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing with excessive theta activity, as well as a slight amount of beta activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to this patientâ€™s previous EEG of August 27, 2003, this tracing again shows no evidence of epileptiform features. This does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The mild background slowing, as well as slight excess of beta activity is a non-specific finding and may be due to medication effect.  Excessive muscle artifact may also obscure the observation of sharp waves.  If seizures remain a clinical concern, a repeat EEG in the lab when the patient is more cooperative may be helpful.
