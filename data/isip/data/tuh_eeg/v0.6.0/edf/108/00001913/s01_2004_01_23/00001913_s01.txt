CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old male with mental retardation, dementia, with a 20-minute shaking episode but without incontinence or tongue biting.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Colace.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V and excess background theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background theta.  There is accentuation of beta frequency activity and some subtle focal slowing identified in the right centrotemporal region, but no definite spike and slow wave activity.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing with accentuation of beta activity in the right centrotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This tracing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  Consideration for a structural or functional abnormality in the right centrotemporal region involving both gray and white matter would be appropriate.
