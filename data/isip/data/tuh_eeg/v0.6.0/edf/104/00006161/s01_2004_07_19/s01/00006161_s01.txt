CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 89-year-old male with bilateral subdural hematomas and a mid-brain stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There are no nursing sheets or other clinical information to indicate that this patient experienced seizures during this recording.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous mixed frequency pattern with a mixture of theta and occasional arrhythmic delta activity.  There is some alpha frequency activity identified in the background.  While sleep states are difficult to define, there are portions of the record with more delta and/or beta.  There are portions of the record with more of a disruption of faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere than the left and these seem to represent a sleep state for this individual.  
HR/EKG:  N/A.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal 24-hour video EEG monitoring due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting focal slowing, with more consistent focal slowing from the right during sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.   No epileptiform features were seen.  Correlation with imaging may be valuable in placing this record in the proper clinical context.
