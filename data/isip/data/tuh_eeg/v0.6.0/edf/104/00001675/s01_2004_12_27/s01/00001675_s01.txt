CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 22-year-old male with chronic static encephalopathy,  mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and refractory childhood epilepsy.  Last seizure three months ago.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tranxene, Luride, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Stimulation of the patient was not performed.  The patient is awake and at times seemingly asleep. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During the majority of the tracing, there is a fair amount of muscle artifact visible in a number of leads.  The posterior dominant rhythm seems to be about 6 Hz.  The background is significantly disorganized. There are frequent spike and sharp waves seen over the left hemisphere mainly around C3 and F3.  At times, there is activity seen at P4, P6, as well as Cz.  These discharges do not generalize and at times correlate with this patient’s movement activity such as patting of the right arm.  During some portions of the record, the patient becomes briefly atonic during which there is more rhythmicity visible in the focal discharges without any evidence of generalization.  On two occasions, the patient had an episode of staring and focal notch twitches, which does not always correlate with the epileptiform activity.  No subclinical seizures were recorded.  
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Multifocal spikes with the majority of the epileptiform activity at C3.
Disorganized and generalized slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The multifocal epileptiform discharges are suggestive of a focal mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy and together with the patient’s behavior and seizure history, this may be consistent with a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  The primary focus, even though they are multifocal discharges, seems to be coming from the left central region.
