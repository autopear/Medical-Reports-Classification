CLINICAL HISTORY: 80-year-old woman of unknown handedness with acute change in mental status and possible stroke. Tracheotomy with supplemental oxygen. No H and P or other clinical information was provided in the chart at the time of the EEG. 
MEDICATIONS: Labetalol, Aspirin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens the patient is uncomfortable and lying on a stretcher. The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with an intra hemispheric asymmetry. There is an alpha rhythm on the right which reaches 10 Hz, 50 mV but the left hemisphere demonstrates significant arrhythmic delta. The arrhythmic delta is seen from the left temporal region and is nearly continuous with disruption of faster frequency activity and some sharply contoured delta or sharp waves. In addition, TIRDA is identified with temporal rhythmic theta and delta. Features of drowsiness included increase in background slowing. Brief vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response on the right but not the left. 
HR: 78 bpm, irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. lntrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency on the left compared to the right, sharply contoured delta, sharp waves and rhythmic temporal theta delta. 
2. Mild background slowing on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left involving both gray and white matter. This abnormality may be epileptogenic. No seizures were recorded.
