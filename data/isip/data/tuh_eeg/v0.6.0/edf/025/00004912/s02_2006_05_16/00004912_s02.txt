CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 19-year-old male status-post head trauma December 20, 2005.  Patient post-op day #40 following a right craniectomy.  The patient has a bone plaque in his head with recurrent complications including fluid formation on the right with herniation of the right brain into the left side of the cranial vault and infected VP shunt, now with an episode which may have been a seizure today. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Trazodone, morphine, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is responsive and at one point appearing to try to interact with the team.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for the relative paucity of cerebral activity on the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a continuous pattern with rhythmic theta.  There are some bursts with higher amplitude more chaotic-appearing arrhythmic delta activity, as well as some underlying left frontotemporal sharp waves and occasional bursts of high amplitude left frontal delta.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Relative paucity of cerebral activity on the right.
A continuous pattern on the left, but at times with bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and/or sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function particularly on the right.  The left hemisphere does demonstrate epileptogenic potential.  Compared to a previous long-term monitoring, no seizures were recorded today.
