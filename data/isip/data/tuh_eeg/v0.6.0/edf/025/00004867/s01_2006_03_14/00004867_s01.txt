CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 40-year-old woman with epilepsy following a craniotomy for aneurysm.  Hypertension and depression.  Last seizure one month ago.
MEDICATIONS: Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Abilify, morphine, methadone, Dilantin, and HCTZ.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The patientâ€™s previous EEGs were not available at this time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is intermittent rhythmic theta from the left hemisphere.  Although there is a breach rhythm, and there is some muscle artifact, there appears to be an underlying spike and slow wave complex identified from the left mid-temporal region, accentuated by hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation, the patient becomes drowsy and in drowsiness there are vertex waves and POSTS.  The amplitude is somewhat higher from the left than the right, accentuating the POSTS on the left.  As the patient reaches sleep, in this sharply contoured background, there is both accentuation of beta on the left but there are a handful of sharp waves that also come out of this background.  Snore artifact is also identified in stage II sleep.   
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, which is markedly accentuated on the left.
HR:  54 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal theta accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation.
Left temporal sharp waves in hyperventilation and in stage II sleep.  The morphology is compatible with a breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The prominent breach rhythm accentuates the beta activity in stage II sleep and produces an increase in the amplitude of the background in photic stimulation, but is simply a manifestation of the previous craniotomy.  The focal slowing and sharp waves supports a temporal lobe disturbance and a localization-related mechanism for seizures.
