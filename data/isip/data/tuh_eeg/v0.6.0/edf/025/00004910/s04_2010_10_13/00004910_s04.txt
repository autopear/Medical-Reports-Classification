CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old male admitted on September 5 with status epilepticus, past history of left frontal parietal craniotomy with left ACA clip.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Ativan,
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKGï¿½ This long-term monitoring begins at 10:57 a.m. after the patient has received medications.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the background EEG is quite slow.  It is primarily a mixture of delta and theta.  There are intermittent bursts of sharp waves  identified from the right hemisphere  primarily with a right mid to anterior temporal region.  The initial sections of the record are richer in beta frequency than others.
There are occasional bursts of sharp waves,  particularly at 10:37 p.m. on the night of the 5th, followed by a somewhat discontinuous pattern at 10:16.  Additional sharp waves appear again in bursts at 11:02.
This long-term monitoring session is divided into several sections.  At the end of the first section at 10:57 a. m. on the 6th, there are bursts of sharp waves but no sustained seizures.
On September 6 through September 7, this section of the EEG continues to demonstrate a slow pattern primarily with theta but some variabilities, some sections richer in beta, others with theta.  There are intermittent bursts of sharp waves noted in the background.
A prominent burst is noted at 5:02 a.m. while the patient is sleeping and is not associated with any clinical changes.
At the end of the record on the morning of the 7th, the patient is intubated, drowsy. There are sharp waves but no sustained bursts.
	HR:	84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal  EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
	2.	Focal slowing.
	3.	Sharp waves from the right temporal and frontotemporal region.
	4.	Occasional discontinuity.
	5.	Particularly in the later sections, occasional bursts or trains of sharp waves without clinical correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports an irritative, epileptiform focus.  The activities emanate from the right hemisphere which is the area of previous craniotomy. No sustained seizures were identified. At the close of the record, there are ongoing sharp waves suggesting an ongoing irritative process.
