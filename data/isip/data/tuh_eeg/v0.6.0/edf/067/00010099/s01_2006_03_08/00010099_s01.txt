HISTORY: 75 yr old woman with previous stroke, heart failure, depression.   Found to have a left temporal laceration and an intercerebral hemorrhage.
	MEDIC ATION: Morphine, Dilantin, others. ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation and Hyperventilation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background  EEG is  somewhat   slow  and  disorganized  with  an  intrahemispheric  asymmetry.     There  is attenuation of on the left compared to the right and there is occasional arrhythmic delta. The overall background is primarily theta but at times an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm can be seen.   Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing with occasional vertex waves.
HR:  72BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Generalized  background slowing
2.   Focal slowing on the left with attenuation of faster frequency and focal delta
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this record.  This EEG supports both a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a structural or functional abnormality on the left.
