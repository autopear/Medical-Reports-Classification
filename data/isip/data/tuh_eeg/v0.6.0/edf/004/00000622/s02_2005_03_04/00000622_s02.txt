CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 34-year-old woman with intractable epilepsy with seizures often occurring during sleep with occasional tongue biting.  Seizure onset at age
14.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal and Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in  the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.   There are frequent left anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes identified in wakefulness. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, which seems to accentuate the epileptiform activity, as well as accentuating rhythmic, somewhat sharply contoured 3 to 5 Hz activity seen from the left temporal region.   The patient reports no clinical symptoms with the ongoing rhythmic slowing maximum at T1, but with involvement of F7.   During HV, there are occasional bursts of hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Following HV, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in amplitude of the background followed by the appearance of vertex waves and occasional spindles.   Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not clearly activate the record.
HR:  72BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Left temporal sharp and slow wave complexes.
2.   Prolonged, rhythmic theta from the left anterior temporal region.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: These featues are similar ro previous studies and support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
