CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old woman with history of seizure onset at age 15. Last 
seizure March 12, 2009 with frequency of 4-7 a year. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hypoventilation and photic 
stimulation performed. Awake through stage 2 sleep. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is a well organized 
posterior alpha rhythm that just reaches 8.5 Hz. There is a subtle interhemispheric 
asymmetry with some slower temporal irregularity of theta seen. This is accentuated 
during drowsiness and especially when the patient awakens and there is quicker return 
of alpha in the left hemisphere. Drowsiness is seen with increasing slowing of the 
background. Stage 2 sleep is seen with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles. 
Hyperventilation does not activate the record. There is no driving in photic stimulation. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Minimally abnormal EEG due to; 
1. An interhemispheric asymmetry with minimally slower activity seen in the right 
temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity or seizures recorded in 
this record. The subtle asymmetry may be nonspecific or minimal structural asymmetry. 
Further clinical correlation is recommended.
