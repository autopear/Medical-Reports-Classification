INTRODUCTION: 
Routine EEG was performed using the 1 0-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode. Stage I sleep was recorded. No activation procedures were performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Include Dilantin and Depakote. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
None. 
HISTORY: 
An 80-year-old man presents with history of schizophrenia, stroke, seizure disorder that presents with the episodes of eyes rolling back and unresponsiveness. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The study opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best is 8 Hz with 20 to 70 microvolts amplitude and which is symmetric to eye opening. There is moderate-to-large amount of diffuse beta rhythm of 15 to 25Hz and 13 to 50 
microvolts seen. Sleep stage I is seen. No hyperventilation or photic stimulation were performed. There is diffuse excessive theta in wakefulness and occasional focal slow waves at F8/T 4 (4Hz and 20-60 microvolts). During the 
recording, the patient arouses and exhibits irregular arm shaking movements, as well as mouth movements with no abnormal EEG correlate. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
1. Generalized slow waves 5 to 7 Hz and 20 to 70 microvolts. 
2. Occasional right anterior temporal polymorphic delta 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG, awake and sleep due to generalized diffuse slow waves and right anterior temporal delta seen 
occasionally. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals evidence of right anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction and additional diffuse cerebral dysfunction, 
both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
