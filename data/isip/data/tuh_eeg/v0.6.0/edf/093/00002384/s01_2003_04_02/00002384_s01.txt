CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 23-year-old male with MVA, multiple injuries, head injury requiring treatment with Dilantin.  Admitted with right flank pain, fever, rash, and acute renal failure.
MEDICATIONS: Percocet, Dilaudid, Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is primarily a drowsy record. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric. The vast majority of the record is drowsiness with rhythmic background theta.  Symmetric vertex waves are identified in stage I sleep.  
Brief awake state is characterized by an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR:  88 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG at the limits of normal primarily in drowsiness.   
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The excessive drowsiness may be due to this patientâ€™s medications.  A follow-up EEG in the lab when the patient is more alert may be helpful in determining whether or not there is an underlying epileptic focus in this individual with head trauma.
