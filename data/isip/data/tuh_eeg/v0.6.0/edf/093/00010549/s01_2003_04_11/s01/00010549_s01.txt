CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 81-year-old male with a fall, acute left MCA infarct, old infarcts in the right posterior circulation plus subdural hematoma and microcephaly.
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Vasotec, Nitro-Bid. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is lethargic throughout. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, relatively featureless with low voltage theta and delta. There are occasional shifting asymmetries, but no strong lateralization.  Spontaneous movements of the face are associated with an increase in the theta frequency activity.
HR:  66 BPM, sometimes irregular. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to: 
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the abnormalities identified from each hemisphere for this individual, the background is relatively symmetric. No epileptiform features were seen and no seizures were recorded.
