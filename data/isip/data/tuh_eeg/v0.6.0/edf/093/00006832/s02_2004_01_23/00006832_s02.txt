CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 44-year-old woman with epilepsy for the past ten years with acceleration of spells characterized by shaking of the head from side to side, arms going up and down, and crying.  
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Topamax, and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the LTM Unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness and in the transition to early drowsiness, there is occasional, subtle focal slowing from the left anterior temporal region with a left anterior sharp and slow wave complex typically maximum at T1/F7, but on one occasion more clearly involving the left frontal region. In the transition to drowsiness, there is rhythmic, bitemporal 5 Hz activity compatible with rhythmic, mid-temporal theta of drowsiness.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  
Hyperventilation produces some rhythmic, bilateral slowing.  The rhythmic, mid-temporal theta activity described above as well as some irregular temporal theta and even occasional sharp waves are also elicited in HV.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the presence of a normal variant and occasional EKG artifact in the left temporal region, this patient clearly has underlying epileptiform activity in this region.  No seizures were recorded.  
HYPERVENTILATION: Hyperventilation was performed at 12:16:27.  A small amount of background slowing, but no seizures were recorded. 
Long-Term Monitoring, 12/13/03 to 12/14/03
EVENT TIME 21:40:  The patient reports feeling as if she is about to have a seizure.  At 21:40, she is awake with a normal awake EEG without epileptiform activity.  At 21:42:__â€¦ (**I again had crackling on the line and could not hear you.**)  At 21:43:07 she starts moving her right arm up and down and very slowly begins to shake her head from side to side.  The tech talks to the patient and the motor activity is extremely non-specific, with slow shaking of the head from side to side.  This is a very slow frequency shaking from side to side until 12:43:35 when the patient starts shaking her head a bit more vigorously.  The heart rate throughout these symptoms is 90 BPM.  At 9:21:46 this starts to slow and at 21:46:20, immediately afterwards, the nurse talks to the patient and the patient is able to answer questions.  As soon as she stops shaking her head, a normal awake pattern is identified.  
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP:  In wakefulness, there is a fair amount of movement artifact, but in the transition to and from stage sleep, there is irregular theta frequency activity primary seen in the left anterior temporal/frontal regions.  Despite the EKG artifact, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles, there are occasional left temporal sharp waves.  Sleep appears to be somewhat fragmented in part by the nursing schedule. 
Long-Term Monitoring, 12/14/03 to 12/15/03
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: No electrographic or clinical seizures were identified in this section of the record.  
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP:  In drowsiness, there are occasional left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave and spike and slow wave complexes.  These may be associated with focal slowing.  Stage I and stage II sleep are captured during the day.  In the transition to and from drowsiness, there was occasional rhythmic mid-temporal theta seen bilaterally.
HR:  66 to 90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional left temporal sharp and slow wave and spike and slow wave complexes with associated focal slowing primarily seen in drowsiness. 
A behavioral event without EEG change. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy, however, the behavior that was recorded was not associated with an EEG change and had behavioral correlates most compatible with a non-epileptic seizure.
