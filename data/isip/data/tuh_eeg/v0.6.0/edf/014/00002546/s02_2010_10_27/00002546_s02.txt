CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed woman with previous stroke, admitted with epilepsy partialis continous and now with intermittent complex seizures characterized by a rushing feeling.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote  
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient pushes the button for all of her clinical events. In addition, there is multiple practice push buttons. The patient reports aurous that the feeling that the fluid is rushing up in her brain and draining out with a bad taste in her mouth.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This patient experiences multiple complex partial seizures with an EEG correlate osteoarthritis of which are seen in the morning of 10/8/2010. There are a handful in the morning of 10/9/2010, and by the morning of 10/10/2010, when she does have push buttons, they no long showed an EEG correlate. The majority of the seizures are characterized by abrupt onset of high amplitude epileptiform activity in the right anterior temporal region. The activity seems to be most prominent at FP8 and sometimes seem to start FP2 and then quickly transitions to F8. The T2 and T4 electrodes are also involved but overall this is an anterior temporal focus. Postictally there is marked suppression of the activity from the right frontotemporal region.  
Interictally, rhythmic right anterior temporal 3 to 5 Hz activity is seen, maximum F8/T2.  
The offset of most of the seizures is abrupt.  
The patient is tested throughout the majority of the seizures and is able to answer questions through all of them.  
Later on in the recording, as the patient is treated with seizure medications and the seizure abate, the EEG during the push buttons is more or less characterized by rhythmic slowing but without the well-defined, high amplitude epileptiform activity.  On the last day of the EEG recording, the 9th through the 10th, she reports that she had no seizures on the morning of 10/9/2010. There are some push buttons but unfortunately there is no clear EEG correlate and no impairment of awareness.  
HR: N/A  
IMPRESSION: EEG monitoring was remarkable for: 
1. Complex partial seizures from the right anterior temporal region with a little bit of variability but most of which are maximum at F8.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: An additional way of looking at this would be an average reference include the T2 electrode. While the activity may start frontal, it seems to generate and be through the anterior temporal region.
