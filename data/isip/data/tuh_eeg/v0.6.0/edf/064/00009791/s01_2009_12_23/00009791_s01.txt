CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed male with schizophrenia, childhood head trauma, vagal nerve stimulator, mental retardation, frequent falling, tonoclonic seizures, requiring 12 mg of Ativan on the 2151 of December. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Keppra, Risperdal, Insulin, Ativan, Lovenox, Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is no mention of a craniotomy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta. There is an intermittent asymmetry with primarily theta frequency activity in the right hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions with delta on the left, but other sections of the record demonstrate a more symmetric pattern. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. There is a poorly-formed right temporal sharp wave noted out of the background. 
HR: 72 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slow and disorganized background. 
2. lntrahemispheric asymmetry with at times more theta on the right compared to the left. 
3. Shifting slowing. 
4. Right temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. This is a bi-hemispheric process but the few sharp waves noted were on the right.
