	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	72-year-old, right-handed woman with aneurysm clipped many years ago, complex partial epilepsy, well controlled until 2007 now with persistent post ictal encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:   Tegretol, topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In drowsiness the activity on the right is of theta frequency pattern.  The left demonstrates  higher amplitude arrhythmic delta activity, breach rhythm and occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an increase in alpha frequency in the background but afterwards the patient rapidly drifts off to sleep.  After cognitive testing is performed, additional sharp waves are observed on the left temporal region with variable maximum.  Some are anterior temporal, others demonstrated  a phase reversal in the posterior temporal parietal region.

After cognitive testing is performed, additional sharp waves are observed on the left temporal region with variable maximum.   Some are anterior temporal, others demonstrated  a phase reversal in the posterior temporal parietal region.  Infusion of Depakote at 1529 produced no real change in the epileptiform activity from the left temporal region.  The technologist  noted that the
patient was a little sleepier and there was a little slowing on the right.   Prolonged EEG is
recorded in the lab with the patient drowsy.  The background continues to demonstrate an interhemispheric  asymmetry with arrhythmic sign on the left and occasional sharp wave but no seizures are observed.
	HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This 1-hour and 15 minute EEG was remarkable for left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves in the left hemisphere, which are prominent.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The pattern described is more likely late ictal or postictal than actually ictal.
