CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with CHF, HTN, prosthetic cancer, CRI, LVAD placed December 20, 2002 with facial twitching, recurrent episodes of V-tach requiring cardioversion; evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone, Dabutamine, many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is comatose and intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is unresponsive.  The background EEG is low to medium amplitude but continuous and relatively symmetric with rhythmic theta and delta frequency activity.  On one or two occasions, there are wave forms which resemble vertex waves.  The patient is stimulated on multiple occasions.  On some but not on all occasions, stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle activity, as well as an increase in theta frequency activity.  In this record, there are two bursts of sharply contoured delta activity maximum at T2. 
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Replacement of normal background with a mixture of theta and delta activity, slightly higher amplitude in the right anterior temporal region than the left.
Suspicious, sharply contoured activity from the right anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This tracing supports the diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter.  Of note, this individual demonstrates the activity to external stimuli on some occasions but not consistently.  This would support a more severe disorder of cerebral function.
