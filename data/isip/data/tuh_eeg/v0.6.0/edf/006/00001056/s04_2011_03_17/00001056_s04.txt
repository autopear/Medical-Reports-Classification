CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old left handed female with TIA, episode of acute DKA 
with abnormality in mental status, left gaze deviation, and right sided weakness, which 
responded to Ativan. 
Dilantin, Zocor, Hydralazine, Diovan, ASA, Zocor, Moxifloxacin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is conversant, but 
somewhat confused. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a somewhat slow 
pattern, but there is a definable 8 Hz alpha rhythm with excess theta. In this bedside 
record there are minor, shifting asymmetries, particularly in frontal central beta. Sleep is 
not sustained. 
HR: 60 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1 . Excess theta. 
2. Mild shifting asymmetries with a little less beta activity in the left frontal region. 
CLINICAL In the context of DKA these findings could represent a 
metabolic pattern or they could be correlated with a structural abnormality. If there is 
any concern about additional seizures, a follow up EEG recording is suggested.
