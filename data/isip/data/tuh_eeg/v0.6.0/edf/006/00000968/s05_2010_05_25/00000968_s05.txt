CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old with Noonan syndrome and recurrent seizures last night. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin. Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10.20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are 
performed. Patient is not intubated but quite somnolent. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The bad<ground EEG includes generous beta activity, 
Stimulation
underlying delta. There is occasional focal delta in the right centrotemporal region. 
As the 
patient drifts off to. sleep, there seems to be high amplitude spiky POSTS present bilaterally in a 
sleep state that is congruent with stage 2 sleep. There is a brief arousal also noted In the 
record. Electrographically there is a brief discharge in the record with alpha frequency activity, 
higher amplitude on the right than the left. It looks like an atypical arousal but may well 
represent a pathologic pattern In this individual. At the close of the record. the patient is restless 
and moving about. 
of the patient elicits an arousal with theta and then vertex waves as he drifts off to sleep. 
HR: 120bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2.
Posterior delta. 
3. Right centrotemporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL These findings-were identified previously for this individual. 
No 
seizures were recorded. 
EEGs have only been recorded in the individual who has been very 
sick with many seizures and so his overall baseline background has never been defined, but 
additional recording when he is well may be of value.
