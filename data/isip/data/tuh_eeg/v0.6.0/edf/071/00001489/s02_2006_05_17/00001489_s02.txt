CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 40-year-old woman with posttraumatic epilepsy, seizure-free for one year, but had a hysterectomy 4/3/06 with complications and had a seizure associated with a low Dilantin level.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, Tylenol, Motrin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a scant amount of subtle slowing in the posterior temporal regions identified bilaterally.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are rare left temporal sharp waves identified in this record.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Rare left temporal sharp waves with sharply contoured delta. 
Rare, subtle independent right or left temporal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Compared to two previous EEGs, these findings are less remarkable than previous studies.
