CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old male with epilepsy with a seizure two days ago.  Seizures are characterized by loss of consciousness and confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is deferred, but photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is asleep with vertex waves and spindles.  As he is awoken, there are a handful of left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes with associated left temporal focal slowing.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there are also occasional right anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes.  Additional, more sustained stage II sleep recording is symmetric.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep, but does elicit an occipitally predominant sustained driving response, particularly at slower flash frequencies. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
High amplitude left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes.
Independent left frequent right anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complexes. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  Correlation with imaging is appropriate.  Of note, the driving response at slower flash frequencies almost had a phase reversal on the right, and this may be part of the underlying focal epilepsy rather than an epileptiform nature to the photic response.
