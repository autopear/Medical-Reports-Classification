CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old male with TRANS MC with seizures found lying in the street after loss of consciousness.  First ever seizure. History of schizophrenia and tumor in the chest. 
MEDICATIONS: Benztropine, Dilantin, and Ativan.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There are some technical issues related to hygiene, but there is no epileptiform activity seen in this record.   
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If there is a strong suspicion for a seizure disorder, a follow-up study after the patient has had a chance to clean up and is able to participate in hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and sleep may be useful.
