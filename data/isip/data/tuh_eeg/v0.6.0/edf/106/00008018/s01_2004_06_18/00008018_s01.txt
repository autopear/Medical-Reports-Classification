CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 34-year-old, right-handed woman with a history of childhood epilepsy characterized by some sort of oral pharyngeal activity, psychiatric illness, admitted with vaginal bleeding and evaluated for excessive somnolence. 
MEDICATIONS: Haldol and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is primarily an asleep record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the record demonstrates stage II sleep with generous spindles, POSTS, and K complexes. Stimulation of the patient elicits brief alerting, but the patient is unable to sustain wakefulness.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG within normal limits in stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Consideration for a disorder of hypersomnolence would be appropriate. No epileptiform features were seen.
