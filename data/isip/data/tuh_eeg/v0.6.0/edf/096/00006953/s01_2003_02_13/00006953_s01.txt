CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 22-year-old, right-handed woman with a history of childhood epilepsy which she outgrew, but five seizures in adulthood with one in October 2002 and another on 1/24/03.  Seizure associated with a multi-vehicle accident.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 40 to 60 V posterior dominant rhythm.  There is some head rocking artifact, but there is a subtle transient with increase in amplitude and some rhythmic theta frequency activity in the right parietal and posterior temporal region, which is in the same region as the posterior scalp.  This is seen occasionally in wakefulness and again into drowsiness.  In addition, in drowsiness there is a single right, T4 transient of approximately 200 milliseconds duration.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a small degree of background theta.  
Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving at intermediate and faster flash frequencies.  
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Mild excess background theta.
Subtle transient in the right parietal temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing described above may be due to a post-concussive state or this patientâ€™s pain medications.  No definite epileptiform activity is seen.  A follow-up tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful to more clearly delineate epileptiform activity.
