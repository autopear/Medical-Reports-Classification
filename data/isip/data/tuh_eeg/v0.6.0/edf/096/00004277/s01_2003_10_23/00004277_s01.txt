CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 54-year-old male with epilepsy since age 13 with tonic-clonic seizures, postictal confusion, non-compliant with medication.
MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a central MU rhythm, although testing is not performed.  In maximal wakefulness, there is a very small degree of background disorganization and a small amount of excess theta.   
In the transition to drowsiness, there are rare bursts of shifting slowing.  In addition, there is a single sharply contoured transient identified from the left.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces an increase in the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Modest background slowing and mild disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The features described above are non-specific and may be due to medications or postictal state.  If further characterization of this patientâ€™s epileptiform activity is needed, a repeat study may be of use.
