CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 77-year-old woman with limited past medical history, found seizing with left motor activity.  HHNK.  Intubated and transiently hypotensive, now poorly responsive with rare spontaneous movements on the right. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Hydralazine, Lopressor, Valium. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record show a very low voltage pattern with primarily beta frequency activity.  In this bedside portable record, there appears to be some attenuation in the posterior quadrant on the right.  As the recording continues, there are occasional spontaneous movements noted.  In addition, there is some 4 to 5 Hz theta frequency activity picked up.  This reaches amplitudes of 20 to 30 V.  The theta is sometimes higher amplitude from the left than the right.  As the recording continues, the patient becomes increasingly active with eye movements seen and yawning in an intubated patient.  
HR:  112 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, primarily beta pattern.
Asymmetry with higher amplitude theta on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen and no seizures were recorded.  This tracing supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  Medications may provide the beta frequency activity.  In that there are some asymmetries identified in this very low voltage record, comparison with neuroimaging may be of use.
