CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 35-year-old male with syncope, change in mental status, and two-minute tonic-clonic seizure with old subdural infarct.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent but extubated.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage.  Much of the record represents sleep, but with stimulation the patient has eye opening and then a low voltage mixed frequency pattern with theta and smaller amounts of beta.  After stimulation is stopped, slow rolling eye movements are accompanied by primarily a theta frequency pattern.   At the recording continues, stimulation of the patient produces a more vigorous alerting response with an alpha frequency activity and then later on features of typical stage II sleep with vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were seen.  This EEG represents an improvement from a previous study in that an awake pattern can be defined albeit with a somewhat slow background.  In addition, normal wave forms of stage II sleep are seen.  Again, no focal or epileptiform features were seen.
