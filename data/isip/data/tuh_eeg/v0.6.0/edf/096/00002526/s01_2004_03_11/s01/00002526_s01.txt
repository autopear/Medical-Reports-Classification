CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 56-year-old male with change in mental status with aggression. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Risperdal, and Haldol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an alpha rhythm of 8 to 8.5 Hz, 30 to 50 uV and occasional right or left temporal theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing, as well as an increase in beta activity followed by vertex waves.  K complexes are seen in stage II sleep.  
Photic stimulation failed to elicit a driving response.  
HR:  56 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing with excess theta and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and may be due to medication effect, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, or postictal state.  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.
