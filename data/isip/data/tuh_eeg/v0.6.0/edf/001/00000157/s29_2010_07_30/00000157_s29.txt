HISTORY:  67 year old ambidextrous female with recurrent seizures.
SIM
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Topamax,  Keppra, Dilantin, Zoloft, Keppra, Labetalol,  Protonix, Carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
OF  THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffuse theta frequency pattern.  In addition, there are repetitive sharp waves, which may be seen independently from the right or left temporal region or occasionally  bilaterally. The
patient received a loading dose of phenytoin at 12:52. Before and after this, more of the repetitive sharp activity is seen in the right temporal region. There are some sustained left temporal discharges, but there are more significant discharges from the right compared to the left, particularly in the early portions of the record.  The recording continues in the morning of July 1, 2010.  By  11:36 a.m. there is less in the way of prolonged periodic complexes, however, electrode integrity is increasing compromised.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	An abnormal, rhythmic theta background.
2.		Periodic sharp waves and bursts of sharp wave seen today, a bit more so from the right.
3.	Independent left anterior temporal sharp waves.
4. 		Some periodic complexes, which given the limitations of this record seem to be bitemporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This pattern is a pattern previously identified for this individual, but not seen for some time and raises concerns about epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere.
