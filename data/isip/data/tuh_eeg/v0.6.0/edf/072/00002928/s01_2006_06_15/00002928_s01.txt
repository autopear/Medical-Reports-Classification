CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 52-year-old male transferred from an outside hospital following 15 seizures, intubated for status epilepticus, and moved to the ICU due to additional shaking spells.   History of childhood epilepsy with recurrent adult epilepsy.  History of an MI in 2000, stent x 2, catherization in 2005, COPD, fibromyalgia, and MVA and a gun shot wound to the abdomen.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described initially as uncooperative.  He then has a spell and afterwards is poorly responsive, but the patient was not re-stimulated because of the fact that he continued to be agitated or uncooperative.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG demonstrates generous beta activity.  The patient seems to be transitioning between wakefulness and stage II sleep with spindle activity.  Tremulousness is associated with some theta.  With stimulation, the record improves with some alpha and theta frequency activity. The patient is snoring intermittently while awake.  The patient has an episode of shaking during the EEG, in which he is holding onto the side rails of the bed and arching his chest. This is approximately 45 seconds in duration.  He is looking about during the spell.  Afterwards, he has his eyes closed.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm identified of approximately 7 Hz.  After the event ends, when the tech calls the patient, he lifts his head and looks in her direction briefly, but is not otherwise cooperative.  He drifts off to sleep later in the record with beta activity, spindles, and intermittent arousals with snoring. 
 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Excess background theta. 
	Excess background beta.
	A behavioral event without a clear clinical correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the background is abnormal, the behavior in question was associated with evidence of purposeful activity in association with shaking (holding onto the side rails). In addition, he responded to his name and was moving about purposefully immediately after the event.  
This patientâ€™s medication exposure may play a role in the excess beta and theta described above.
