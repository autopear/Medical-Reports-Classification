CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old woman with dementia and recurrent sharp waves in the right hemisphere. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Topamax, Keppra, Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive. She has on going periodic complexes and perhaps some twitching. Throughout the course of the record, she receives intubation at 8 p.m. and receives several doses of Phenobarbital at 20:00 hours and then Ativan at 6:15 a.m. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The recording begins with a very slow background with a periodic complex in the right hemisphere. It is essentially a continuous pattern. This pattern is slower than seen on the baseline study and demonstrates less in the way of frequency evolution. 
At intubation, the patient receives much higher doses of sedative hypnotic medications resulting in cessation of the epileptiform activity or at least a waning of the epileptiform activity. The epileptiform activity gradually recurs out of the right hemisphere leading to the use of the Phenobarbital. 
The overnight recording demonstrates essentially a much improved pattern with less in the way of periodic sharp wave in the right hemisphere although by the early morning hours, the activity is returning. 
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: The close of the record demonstrates the pattern was generous beta activity. The poorly formed periodic sharp wave in the right hemisphere is observed once again, but is significantly slower. The video does not indicate additional seizures at that time.
