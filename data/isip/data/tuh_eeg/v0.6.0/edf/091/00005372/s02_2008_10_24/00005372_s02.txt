CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year-old female with a history of seizure with onset at 20
years. The patient describes seizures as loss of awareness with postictal confusion. 
The patient also has a history of psychiatric illness. Last was in July. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrodes and 1 channel EKG. Photic and hyperventilation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the patient's EEG is diffusely slow 
with alpha activity at 7.5 Hz. There is also evidence for excess background theta. The 
patient does get drowsy during the record with occasional vertex waves. Photic 
stimulation is performed, which shows minimal driving. 
HR: 60 bpm 
1. Slow alpha 
2. Excessive background theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The patient's EEG does not show any focal epileptiform 
features. The abnormal slow background is suggestive of a diffuse disturbance of 
cerebral function as seen in metabolic disorders.
