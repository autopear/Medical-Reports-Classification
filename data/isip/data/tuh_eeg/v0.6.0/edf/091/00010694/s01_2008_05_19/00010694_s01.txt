MR: 24900185 
CLINICAL HISTORY: 62-year-old gentleman found down at home and had multiple 
seizures en route to the hospital. Loaded with Dilantin. Now poorly responsive. History 
of diabetes, hypertension, COPD, blindness and trauma. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Metformin, Advair, Albuterol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is arousable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG waxes between a drowsy state 
with some spontaneous arousals. The over all pattern is somewhat slow, but with 
stimulation there is an alpha theta reasonably well-organized pattern. As he drifts off to 
sleep, increasing in slowing is observed. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. 
Asymmetric eye artifact is observed in this individual with blindness. Electrode artifact is 
picked up at P3. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces no learning response. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL There is a suggestion, particularly in the very last page of 
the record which is technically better, that there may be an underlying asymmetry on the 
left with disruption of faster frequency activity in the frontal and frontotemporal regions. 
Because of the asymmetry of the eye artifact, please repeat a study when the patient is 
a bit more arousable, having him open and close his eyes.
