CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old dialysis patient with recent status epilepticus with paradoxical reactions to antiepileptic medication, intermittently agitated.  
MEDICATIONS: please check tech sheet  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has received Versed and is intermittently agitated.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record demonstrate diffuse beta activity.  Despite the beta pattern, the patient is intermittently active, shaking his head, coughing, and moving.  As a result, as the recording continues, the electrode integrity is more challenging.  This section of the EEG ends at 12:17 on October 4.  While the EEG is increasingly technically challenging, because artifact, the patient is increasingly awake and agitated as observed on the video.  
HR:  120 BPM 
	IMPRESSION: This section of the EEG does not demonstrate focal or epileptiform activity.  While there are increasing problems with electrode integrity because of the patient’s agitation, the video demonstrates an improvement in the individual’s clinical state.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep would be useful. 
Long-Term Monitoring 10/4/03 at 15:43:01 to 10/5/03 at 12:08:32
CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old gentleman admitted for dizziness and  seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Propofol, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and sedated with Propofol.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric and low voltage with excessive amounts of beta and delta activity.  As the recording continues, the patient becomes more verbal and increased artifact is seen.  At 02:20 on October 5, there was significant increase in head movement with a lot of increased muscle movement in the background.  However, the generalized background with excessive beta activity is seen.  After 3:00, due to movement and disconnection of the electrodes, the EEG is not readable 
HR:  90 BPM. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Excessive beta activity and superimposed slow delta activity.  
Long-Term Monitoring 10/6/03 – EEG# 03-1125
CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old gentleman who presented with dizziness and peripheral vision loss of the left eye, headache, and seizure activity.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is awake and lethargic.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized and diffusely slow.  As the recording continues, occasionally superimposed left temporal theta activity was observed.  By the end of the recording, the patient seems to be more easily arousable and responsive to the nurse and can talk.  At that time, a 7 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm can be seen.  
HR:  90 BPM. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal Long Term Video EEG due to:
	1.  Initiatally Beta pattern
Disorganized background with diffuse slowing and intermittently superimposed left temporal theta activity.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
The initial portions of the record are compatible with pharmacologic coma.  As the patient improves, the background changes to theta and delta.  In that there are focal features at the end, correlation with imaging is suggested.  In this individual with status epilepticus, no epileptiform features were ever identified.
