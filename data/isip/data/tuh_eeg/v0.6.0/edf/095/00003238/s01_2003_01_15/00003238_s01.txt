CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old, right-handed woman with vertigo, blurry vision, and bilateral weakness.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm.  The amplitude of the alpha rhythm is higher on the right compared to the left.  There is a small amount of background theta activity with occasional shifting, slightly arrhythmic temporal theta activity identified from either temporal region. In the transition to stage I and II sleep, there is somewhat asymmetric bursts of shifting, slightly more remarkable on the right than the left.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing a small amount of rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Intermittent, slightly asynchronous bursts identified from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions just prior to the onset of vertex waves or K complexes in the transition to stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The amplitude asymmetry is a non-specific finding and may be related to thickness of the skull or other processes. The asynchronous bursts are of unclear clinical significance and may be even seen following complicated migraines.
