CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 31-year-old male epilepsy.  Last seizure was two weeks ago with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and loss of consciousness.  Auras consist of stomach upset and a rising feeling.  
MEDICATIONS: CBZ
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patientâ€™s Carbamazepine dose is decreased and his Lamotrigine is held during this section of the record.  The patient reports no seizures at this time. 
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The waking record is well organized with a symmetric 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness, there are occasional bursts of sharply contoured arrhythmic delta from the temporal regions, primarily seen from the left.  In addition, in wakefulness through stage II sleep, there are left temporal sharp waves.  These may be subtle or more marked, but in this section of the record can clearly be identified in wakefulness particularly around 11:00 AM on April 6.  As the recording continues, there is increasing electrode artifact and the patient seems to be picking at the electrodes.  
No seizures were recorded.  
HR:  90 BPM.
