	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	42-year-old right-handed male with refractory epilepsy, admitted with frequent, daily seizures, status post treatment with 10 to 14 mg of Ativan and 10 to 14 mg of Haldol on October 14.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is alternating awake and somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall background is slow with delta and theta frequency activity. There were bursts of FIRDA. Some of these include a bifrontal spike and slow wave complex. Others include a right frontal spike and slow wave complex. As the patient drifts off to sleep the background demonstrates increasing and slowing. As he arouses, there is an increase in theta frequency activity. Photic stimulation does not elicit driving.
	HR: 	90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	High-amplitude bursts of rhythmic frontal delta with right frontal sharp waves.
	2.	FIRDA.
	3. 	Background slowing.
	4.	Rare Bifrontal sharps
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
This EEG supports severe disturbance of cerebral function and
suggests more than 1 possible mechanism for epilepsy, including localization-related mechanism. Correlation with imaging is appropriate. Attention to the right hemisphere is recommended.
