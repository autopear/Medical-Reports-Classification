CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old ambidextrous gentleman with obtundation and asterixis. Renal failure, organ transplant patient. Multiple severe medical problems. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, Remeron, Cefepime 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a relatively low voltage pattern. At times, there is a 5-6 Hertz theta frequency background and at other times there is a bit more delta. There is a suggestion of an alpha rhythm with some vertex waves and a few spindles as the patient drifts off to sleep. Sleep is not preserved. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal. The overall pattern is rather symmetric. 
HR: 96bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slow background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to a previous study in September. This record demonstrates left beta which may be due to medications and a bit more theta.
