CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 65-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy with a seizure characterized by right motor activity for 30 minutes, with the second tonic-clonic seizure lasting five minutes.  Significant baseline cardiac and pulmonary disease, as well as diabetes and obesity.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Valproate, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent.  Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in wakefulness includes a low pattern with at best a rhythmic theta and a hint of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is prominent, frontally predominant arrhythmic delta activity and in some sections of the record, the arrhythmic delta activity seems to be slower and more remarkable on the right than the left, although this is not seen throughout the study.  The focal features are less prominent in drowsiness.  In wakefulness, there is an increase in theta frequency activity.   
HR:  94 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Shifting slowing, a little bit more remarkable on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In this individual with significant baseline neurologic problems, previous studies are important to determine how this record compares to prior studies.
