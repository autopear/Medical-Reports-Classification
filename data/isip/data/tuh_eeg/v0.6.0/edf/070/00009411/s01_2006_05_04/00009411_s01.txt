CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old male with a history of IV drug abuse, possible epilepsy, and recent head trauma with a seizure on presentation.  History of multiple previous head traumas in the past. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of background beta and a very small amount of background theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are some eye movements, which are somewhat asymmetric with a suggestion of a bit more theta on the left than the right, but the eye movements are somewhat confounding.  
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG at the limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The excess beta described above may be due to medication effect.  There is a suggestion of left-sided slowing in drowsiness, but there is asymmetric eye movement.  If further characterization of this patientâ€™s epileptiform activity is essential, an outpatient EEG may be useful.
