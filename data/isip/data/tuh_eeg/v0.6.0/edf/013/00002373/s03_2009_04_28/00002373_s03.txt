INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This was an awake and sleep 
study. Photic stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is a posterior dominant 
alpha rhythm seen. An asymmetry is seen in the left central temporal region with 
increase in theta activity.Â· This slowing of the record is accentuated as the patient 
begins to fall asleep. Stage 2 sleep is seen with spindles. During photic stimulation, the 
patient is seen in stage 2 sleep and scant driving is produced. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Left centro-temporal focal slowing seen more during drowsiness and not as
