CLINICAL HISTORY: 63-year-old female patient with positive medical history of 
aneurysm status post clip in 1996 on the right side, history of epilepsy. Last seizure was 
several days ago, reported to be tonic-clonic seizure with loss of consciousness and 
urinary incontinence. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Aricept, Celebrex, Lipitor. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed. 
Photic stimulation was performed. Hyperventilation was not performed secondary to 
severe coughing. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Wakefulness is characterized by alpha rhythm at 9 
cycles per second, amplitude is 50 microvolts. Breech rhythm was observed on the right 
side sharp waves also were observed on the right side mainly at the 
T 4 ..nd F8. Drowsiness is characterized by slower alpha activity and the delta activity on 
the left side also has vertex wave and K complex. Photic stimulation does not activate 
the record. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Intermittent background slowing more on the left side at theta rhythm. 
2. Breech rhythm on the right side. 
3. Right temporal sharp. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports the diagnosis of localization related 
epilepsy and prior craniotomy on the right side.
