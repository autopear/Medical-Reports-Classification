CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old, former alcoholic with a previous history of epilepsy admitted with multiple, repetitive seizures to the Episcopal Emergency Room on the night of the 8th with left-sided shaking followed by obtundation and hypotension.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenytoin, Haldol, and Gabapentin. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a 7-hour study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is low voltage, diffusely slow with a mixture of beta and primarily delta with smaller amounts of theta.  When the sensitivity is increased, there is a bit of a beta asymmetry with a bit less beta in the right posterior quadrant.  The record remains markedly slow throughout with a low voltage beta pattern, and there was a subtle asymmetry in terms of the focal features seen on the right in this very low voltage bedside recording. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Replacement of normal background with a very low voltage, suppressed pattern.
	A subtle asymmetry with a bit more delta and a bit less beta in the right posterior quadrant.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  No epileptiform features were seen and no seizures were recorded.  A repeat study when the patient is out of the ICU to further characterized epileptiform activity is needed.
