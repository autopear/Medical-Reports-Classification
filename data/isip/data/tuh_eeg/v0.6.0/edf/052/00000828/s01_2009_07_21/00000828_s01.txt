CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old man with schizophrenia, depression, and status post a left BKA with onset of seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Ability, Paroxetine, Dilantin, Loperamide, Metoprolol, Guiatuss DM 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed. Awake through stage 1 sleep. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is a minimally disorganized background with a posterior dominant alpha rhythm of 10 Hertz. Overall, however the background is slow with some excess data activity. As the patient becomes drowsy, vertex waves are seen. There is activation during hyperventilation. Photic stimulation causes subtle driving. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Disorganization of the background with excess theta activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seizures or focality seen in this record. The generalized excess theta is a nonspecific finding and can be due to encephalopathy or medications affect. Further clinical correlation is recommended.
