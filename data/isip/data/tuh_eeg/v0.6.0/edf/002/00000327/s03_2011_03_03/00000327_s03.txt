CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old left handed female postpartum female with multiple seizures 
in the past day with little in the way of postictal state. Past temporal lobectomy in 2009. 
MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Keppra, Vimpat, Protonix, Lovenox, Advair, Ventolin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are 
performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm 
which is slightly slower on the left when compared to the right. There is a breech rhythm with 
amplitude activity from the left as well as some underlying theta and delta. In this sharply 
contoured record, there are occasional T3 and T5 sharp waves. The T4 sharp waves occur in 
trains. Stimulation of the patient seems to produce an increase in faster frequency activity 
bilaterally and the focal features on the left are a bit more prominent in the transition toward 
sleep. Somewhat asymptomatic vertex waves are noted and there are POSTS noted in sleep. 
The patient seems to transition in an out of sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a scant driving 
response. In some sections of the sleep recording, with vertex waves and spindles, there are 
sections with the posterior temporal sharp waves and even some left occipital sharp waves. The 
breech rhythm is quite prominent in stage II sleep and the sharp waves range from F7 all the 
way to 01. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing in the left temporal region with disruption of faster frequent activity as well as 
underlying slowing. 
2. Left temporal sharp waves which range in maximum from even the left occipital region to 
the left mid to anterior temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a broad epileptogenic zone. Additional EEG 
recording it may be helpful to capture her frequent events at this time.
