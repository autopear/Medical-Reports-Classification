CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a one-year-old male with a history of perinatal meningitis, hospitalized in January for asthma, now intubated on a Fentanyl and Versed drip for asthma attacks. 
MEDICATIONS: As mentioned above.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a sedated study. Because of the patientâ€™s intubation, the right temporal lobe electrodes were difficult to manipulate. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous.  There is a mixture of frequency in the background.  There is an asymmetry.  There is rich, nearly continuous 6 to 7 Hz activity from the temporal region.  The left temporal region shows more arrhythmic delta.  Of note, the infant is lying on its right side and the left electrodes would be those that would be easier to manage. From the central region, there is again an asymmetry with intermittently, richer alpha and theta frequency activity identified from the right central regions in comparison to the left.  The left also demonstrates a bit more in the way of arrhythmic delta activity.  The patient is never stimulated throughout the study and it is not possible to reposition the child. 
HR:  220 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Technically limited but abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Interhemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity from the left, as well as more arrhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this clinical context, it may have been ill-advised to manipulate the child, but a follow-up EEG should be performed which employs more than a single montage throughout the record and which utilizes stimulation.  No seizures were recorded and there was no epileptiform activity.
