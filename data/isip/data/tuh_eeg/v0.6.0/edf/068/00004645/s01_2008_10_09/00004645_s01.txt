CLINICAL HISTORY: 31-year-old with schizophrenia and new onset tonic clonic 
seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Haldol, Cogentin, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as 
very agitated with continuous movements of the feet. 
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low 
amplitude, reasonably well organized with a scant alpha rhythm observed. When he 
becomes agitated, there is an increase in background slowing. The patient was 
sedated with 2 mg of Haldol during the EEG. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous 
bilateral driving. 
HR: 90 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Increase in background slowing, primarily theta frequency activity associated with 
agitation or administration of Haldol. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION No epileptiform features were observed. The presence of 
theta with agitation suggests that there may be an underlying delirium or metabolic 
encephalopathy
