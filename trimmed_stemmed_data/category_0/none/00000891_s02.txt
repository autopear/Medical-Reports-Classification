reason for studi left cea medic introduct routin eeg was record dure left carotid endarterectomi which was perform use standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit of ekg electrod the patient eeg was perform while he receiv midazolam propofol fentanyl and vecuronium for induct sevofluran phenylephrin epinephrin fentanyl bolus at time nitroglycerin gentamicin and ancef clinic problem none descript of the record the background of the eeg open without normal posterior domin rhythm seen over the right hemispher at hz which was not seen as clear over the left hemispher there is focal slow seen intermitt over the focal hemispher maxim 10 probabl intermitt in addit there was some normal frontocentr beta seen in the bilater frontal region abnorm discharg there are fair frequent to continu focal slow over the left hemispher and dure the record there were some sharp wave seen over the left anterior tempor and frontal and prefront region on the left no seizur were seen procedur the patient was clamp at 11 58 and 24 second and chang was note over the left hemispher for loss of faster frequenc and decreas amplitud at 11 58 and 59 second the patient was unclamp and the eeg normal slowli and the patient was reclamp at 11 01 and 53 and shunt was place in which was open at 11 08 and 29 second the eeg return to baselin after the chang seen with the second clamp be similar to the previous clamp the patient was reclamp to take the shunt out at 11 52 and 31 second and again chang were note over the left hemispher and the clamp was taken out onc the shunt was remov at 12 05 and second the eeg slowli normal afterward to it baselin impress abnorm eeg with chang over the left hemispher with clamp that improv with shunt and return to normal after the procedur focal sharp wave were seen over the left hemispher dure the procedur clinic correl this is an event left carotid endarterectomi due to chang over the left hemispher with clamp which was inform to the surgeon and requir shunt the chang resurfac with shunt and after the procedur the eeg return to baselin all chang were report to the surgeon in addit there is evid of cortic irrit over the left hemispher which may be relat to her previous stroke or mayb correl with histori of seizur clinic correl is recommend
