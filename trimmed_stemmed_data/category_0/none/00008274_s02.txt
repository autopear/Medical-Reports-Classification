reason for studi aortic arch surgeri medic induct was done with vers fentanyl lidocain etomid and vecuronium but isofluran and fentanyl were also use introduct routin eeg was perform dure the surgeri use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterior tempor and single-lead ekg electrod the patient was record while anesthet feedback was given to the surgeon throughout the entir procedur descript of the record the record open to posterior domin rhythm that reach hz and is reactiv to eye open there is some frontocentr beta the patient is easili sedat after some time there is no normal sleep architectur seen activ procedur were perform there is some mild left midtempor anterior tempor focal slow seen intermitt as the record continu by 50 minut into the record intermitt burst or diffus attenu pattern can be seen and as the sedat is increas at around 10 20 the cool process start and as the temperatur decreas there appear to be lower amplitud to the discharg and the longer period of attenu seen throughout the eeg pleas note that the attenu first began on the right hemispher isometr and then pick up on the left hemispher this was inform to the primari team and it was thought to be due to the innomin arteri use for cool at around 10 50 the eeg appear fair suppress more on the right than the left but it was not until about noon that the eeg appear to be final complet suppress at around 12 17 the rewarm start again and burst could be notic as earli as 12 26 the burst appear to be more on the left than the right and with time they appear to be more frequent than higher amplitud and more equal observ over both right and left hemispher the eeg continu to be record as the burst continu to increas and was final stop as the eeg becam much more continu at 47 heart rate pleas note that the heart rate did stop dure the procedur and return appropri as the patient circul was restart impress unev eeg monitor of aortic arch replac surgeri clinic correl this eeg reveal no unexpect chang dure an unev aortic arch bypass surgeri with suppress seen with cool and restor of symmetr eeg activ after rewarm no seizur were observ
