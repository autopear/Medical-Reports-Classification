date of studi septemb 22-23 medic dilantin keppra ativan other introduct continu video eeg monitor was perform in the unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg the patient did not initi understand that he was to push the button for his clinic symptom he was abl to provid excel histori when the data was review with him he did indic that he had well-form visual hallucin at on the even of saturday the 22nd and then the visual distort describ abov he did not understand that he was to have util the seizur pushbutton until the morn of the 23rd descript of the record as this long-term monitor begin there is an intermitt asymmetri with intermitt disrupt of alpha rhythm on the right compar to the left as well as intermitt slow of the alpha rhythm of note nurs did confirm with the patient how to use the pushbutton at 19 on the 22nd seizur time 43 the patient is chew near the onset of the seizur this is prolong epileptiform discharg initi realli onli at t6 o2 by 51 it seem to have spread an is littl bit more promin bilater there is bit more of an occipit field pick up on the left and there is no well-defin alpha note on the left the nurs come to check on the patient and fix the electrod at 11 the nurs spend great deal of time with the patient and they have long convers the patient continu to have an electrograph seizur which wax and wane in term of it spread in the right occipit region with spike and wave activ it may be t6 or o2 maximum after she leav at 27 there is bit more bilater represent the seizur start to slow down at 46 then wax and wane recur at 51 it stop at 03 the patient did not recal addit seizur after that episod subsequ he did disclos that he did recal the event and was awar that he had well-form visual hallucin of see hors there is 2nd seizur at 46 signific briefer 3rd seizur is note at 10 28 again brief discharg from the right occipit region in the overnight record on 09 22-09 23 the patient has mani seizur when confront he did recal that he had the seizur but did not report them to the nurs he has an approxim 30-minut discharg at which is right posterotempor occipit discharg he is test by the nurs who is not awar of the seizur the nurs check the electrod dure the eeg she and the patient have long convers the patient answer question appropri and doe not appear to have disclos the seizur to her the patient is up veri late at night subsequ he has multipl brief seizur at 10 11 04 12 03 12 56 21 37 an addit seizur at 59 is also note which is slight differ and will be mention separ 25 he is drift off to sleep after this the seizur are all about 2-3 minut in durat and are character by spike activ in the right occipit region there is some volum conduct to the left occipit region when the patient drift off to sleep the seizur seem to stop the seizur at 59 is remark for more of pattern of rhythmic theta than the spike and wave activ as the patient is drift off to sleep at 49 he has anoth seizur seem to arous but then drift into stage sleep anoth seizur is note at 10 by this point the patient seem to have transit from pattern of seizur per hour with the onset at to about 1everi hour or so spontan arous from sleep are note at and there are section of the record when the patient is awak at with well-defin symmetr background and then seizur at 02 the seizur and spike detect program pick up seizur at 49 and 54 on the morn of the 23rd the nurs discuss with the patient the seizur that he is experienc he describ them as brief visual distort the subsequ seizur are brief typic 2-3 minut with veri focal epileptiform discharg in the right posterior quadrant the patient describ these seizur as be associ with visual distort the rn and md were present in the unit with the patient the patient still requir remind to push the button he doe volunt verbal after much reinforc that he is have seizur but still forget to push the button with his seizur addit recurr discharg are note at 10 54 50 the patient receiv mg of oral valium around this time he also receiv 1000 mg of levetiracetam an addit seizur is note at 11 11 repeat seizur is note at 11 34 anoth seizur is note at 11 50 the hous offic initi phenytoin around this time seizur is note at 12 05 again the same brief discharg in the right occipit region there is small increas in beta anoth seizur is note at 12 26 and repeat seizur at 12 43 again with the same characterist as the patient becom drowsi there is an asymmetri of dropout of faster frequenc activ on the right compar to the left as the patient start to drift off to sleep at 27 the seizur seem to improv heart rate 84 bpm introduct continu video eeg was perform in the long term monitor unit this section of the record includ septemb 23 and septemb 24 2012 the patient had multipl seizur on the night of septemb 23 2012 slow to infrequ seizur on the morn of septemb 24 2012 descript of the record in much of the wake background the activ is symmetr well defin alpha rhythm stage sleep includ vertex wave k-complex and spindl intermitt complex partial seizur or simpl partial seizur are note from the right occipit region on the night of septemb 23 2012 the patient receiv addit phenytoin and valium there is hiatus between 00 and 52 with simpl partial seizur character by repetit ictal activ and the next seizur at 37 as the record continu on septemb 24 2012 addit sleep is record dure the day with vertex wave and an increas in beta there is an intermitt disrupt of the alpha rhythm on the right heart rate 60 bpm continu 61-year-old male with lyme diseas pituitari adenoma and right subdur hematoma now with recurr hallucin septemb 23rd dure this section of the record the patient is awar of seizur in the earli part of the record seizur was note at 29 on the 23rd after this the patient is sleep and in sleep there is subtl focal slow in the right posterior quadrant consist the patient doe not seem to seiz dure sleep seizur was note by the patient at 03 24 his typic 2-minut seizur the next seizur is at 54 seizur ident to previous describ seizur was note at 19 and anoth one at 35 the next seizur is at 38 59 again last 2-3 minut after this the patient is awak with well-defin alpha anoth seizur was note at 43 and at 46 again seizur was note at 10 and then at 47 at this time the patient is veri good about identifi his seizur he doe not have anoth seizur until 51 and then anoth one at 15 by 16 the eeg demonstr normal awak pattern by 28 the patient is fall asleep and is in stage sleep introduct this continu video eeg monitor is perform use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement descript of the record this last section on the 24th includ signific amount of sleep by this section in the record the patient had learn to push the button for all seizur no seizur were record in the final hour of the eeg record but occasion subtl right occipit spike or sharp wave were note as the record continu the intermitt alpha asymmetri resolv there were some burst of posterior tempor theta but none with the frequenc evolut note with the well-defin seizur there was one more subtl discharg note at 10 with veri subtl spike in the right occipit region this was one of the patient typic 3-minut seizur final brief seizur was record at 17 on the 24th heart rate 120 bpm impress abnorm continu video eeg monitor due to pattern of intermitt seizur quit promin on the morn of the 23rd out of the right occipit region intermitt right occipit slow intermitt right occipit disrupt of the alpha rhythm clinic correl this epileptiform pattern is congruent with this patient imag and support focal mechan for seizur
