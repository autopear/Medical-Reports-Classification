reason for studi seizur medic lorcet which was stop at approxim at night depacon introduct long-term eeg was perform use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with anterior tempor and singl lead ekg electrod the patient was record dure unrespons activ procedur were not perform descript of the record the record reveal background that consist of overal diffus theta and beta discharg with no normal organ or frontal central beta no clear posterior domin rhythm could be identifi the eeg record appear to remain unchang throughout the first 24 hour and with stimul doe not appear to react or chang much around the patient vers drip was stop and there is some mild decreas in the frequenc from more alpha to theta but still some preponder of an alpha frequenc remain at time over the next 24 hour the frequenc in the background slow down to the theta rang and the amplitud decreas they appear to be some unusu reactiv abnorm discharg general slow in the theta alpha rang and disorgan of the background seizur none heart rate 132 impress abnorm eeg due to general theta and alpha and diffus slow clinic correl this eeg reveal evid of diffus cerebr dysfunct which is nonspecif with regard to etiolog the diffus alpha and theta may be seen with anox injuri or altern may be at least in part due to medic effect the decreas in amplitud could signifi cortic damag but the reactiv support some cortic function no seizur were seen
