reason for studi seizur long-term eeg was perform from 12 12 2012 to 12 13 2012 for total of 24 hour use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterior tempor and single-lead ekg electrod the patient was record in wake and sleep activ procedur were not perform medic vimpat zonisamid and keppra technic difficulti dure the last hour of the record the patient had pull the major of the electrod make it difficult to review the eeg but throughout the major of the record there was continu t5 electrod artifact descript of record the record open to posterior domin rhythm that reach hz which is reactiv to eye open there was normal frontocentr beta activ procedur were not perform patient record in wake stage stage ii and deeper stage of sleep abnorm discharg focal slow wave seen continu at f8 t4 and independ at t4 and frequenc of 2-4 hz and amplitud of 20-60 microvolt continu at time with sharp contour and high amplitud consist with breach rhythm event the patient had an event at 31 where she felt that she was go to have seizur second later she stop answer question while she was in the chair she would stare and remain unrespons for about minut she would not follow motor or verbal command dure the entir episod the patient had normal background and no epileptiform activ was seen seizur none impress abnorm eeg due to continu right anterior tempor and mid tempor slow clinic correl this eeg reveal evid of focal cerebr dysfunct in the right anterior tempor and mid tempor region which is consist with known surgeri and injuri in addit there was one episod of unrespons where the patient had no chang in her eeg this is consist with diagnosi of psychogen nonepilept event no seizur were seen
