reason for studi seizur introduct long-term eeg was perform use standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterior tempor and singl lead ekg electrod the patient was record while slight confus activ procedur were not perform continu spike wave detect as well as seizur detect softwar in addit to patient note and nurs event were use to review the eeg medic dilantin and vers technic difficulti there is some intermitt cz electrod artifact seen intermitt throughout the record as well as a1 electrod artifact descript of record the record open to diffus slow background with posterior domin rhythm that at time can be seen best over the left hemispher reach 7-8 hz howev this background improv slight over the last 10 hour and is slight more continu again seen best over the left hemispher and reactiv to eye open there is some frontal central beta seen too especi over the left hemispher and best at the last hour of the record there is no normal sleep architectur howev there is some wake and sleep stage chang that are note activ procedur were not perform abnorm discharg focal sharp wave seen at c4 in pseudoperiod pattern occur almost at 1-2 hz with some intermitt attenu continu throughout the record consist with period later epileptiform discharg pled focal sharp wave seen occasion at f8 t4 in wake and sleep focal slow wave seen continu at c4 at frequenc of 2-4 hz and an amplitud of 20-60 microvolt moder general slow wave seizur none impress abnorm eeg due to right central period later epileptiform discharg as well as right anterior tempor sharp wave in addit to focal slow in the same region there is also moder diffus general slow heart rate 84 clinic correl this eeg reveal evid of focal structur dysfunct and acut irrit over the right central region which is consist with the known hemorrhag and contus in addit there is evid of diffus cerebr dysfunct which is non-specif with regard to etiolog but may be due at least in part to medic effect no seizur were seen these find were report to the primari team
