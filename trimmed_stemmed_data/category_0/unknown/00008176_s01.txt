medic none introduct digit video eeg is perform in the lab use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg hyperventil and photic stimul were perform this is an awak and drowsi record previous eeg not avail for comparison descript of the record in maximum wake the background eeg is appropri organ for child of this age with 10 hz 50 to 70 uv posterior domin rhythm and some posterior slow wave of youth prior to hyperventil the patient is rest comfort the child has an approxim two-second spell of sit up with head jerk and eye open spontan this is an extrem high voltag discharg it is review with sensit of 50 uv mm at this sensit there is general second burst with by the time the entir burst is over is almost three second in durat use various montag the burst is general but doe seem to start with poli spike and slow wave activ in the right frontal region it is follow by two discret spike and slow wave complex which work with differ montag are maximum in the right frontocentr frontotempor region hyperventil is perform and in hyperventil addit burst are identifi again veri high amplitud requir review with sensit of 50 uv mm and burst with spike in all likelihood reach greater than 200 uv with total spike and slow wave discharg reach amplitud of 200 uv and greater the second burst in hyperventil is of similar durat approxim second and that burst is general in natur it doesn seem to start in the right frontal region follow this there is focal spike and slow wave activ again pick up in the right frontocentr region with pair of discharg but without the sustain burst in regard to the brief burst of spike and slow wave activ which occur in hyperventil the video is review the tech indic that the child experienc head tremor with the event that occur in hyperventil and in care review of the video it is clear that the child has seri of head tremor in associ with that burst as well addit clinic discharg are note with an approxim 2-second burst at 15 50 14 and there is seri of three head jerk associ with this burst isol poli spike activ frontal maximum but on the right with simpli pair or trio of discharg do not seem to be clinic signific these occur as the child is fall asleep there is an addit pair of burst as the child transit to sleep and again it is hard to see clinic correl for those burst photic stimul is remark for photoelectr artifact as well as some under drive hr 120 bpm impress abnorm eeg due to clinic seizur character by epileptiform activ with frontal predomin to hz spike and slow wave activ with poli spike compon maximum in the frontal region typic last to second in durat with one or two burst that are longer under right frontal focus clinic event character by head bob typic with three-head bob in most of the discharg clinic correl although the discharg is primarili high amplitud general discharg there is clear under focal in this discharg it may be more appropri to consid this focal frontal mechan for seizur rather than primari general mechan
