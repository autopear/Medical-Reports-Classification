reason for studi seizur medic vimpat and depakot introduct long term eeg was perform use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterior tempor and singl lead ekg electrod the patient was record dure wake and sleep activ procedur were not perform descript of the record the eeg reveal posterior domin rhythm of hz which is best seen over the right hemispher there is some frontal central beta seen best over the right hemispher at time seen over the left activ procedur were not perform some normal sleep architectur is seen abnorm discharg focal slow wave seen continu over p3 and at time t3 at frequenc of 2-4 hz amplitud of 20-60 microvolt focal sharp wave are seen at o1 independ occasion seizur the patient had dure this record electrograph seizur the first one occur at 18 until 28 last for 10 minut it appear to origin at o1 with rhythmic sharp wave in the theta frequenc that increas amplitud and frequenc and appear to spread slight to o2 but remain main in the occipit region dure the event the patient move around but no other clear clinic featur can be seen in the video at 12 30 the patient had anoth seizur last minut this time the patient again was in the bed and no clinic seizur were seen in the eeg there was again in o1 an electrograph seizur that began with discharg of spike in the alpha frequenc that continu to evolv to the theta frequenc and increas amplitud and then sudden stop this one was spread less through the occipit region and stay main at o1 dure the rest of the night no more seizur were seen until and this eeg was review until 00 in the morn heart rate 72 impress abnorm eeg due to electrograph seizur aris from the left occipit region in addit to focal slow seen continu over the left hemispher maxim in the pariet and tempor region clinic correl this eeg reveal or is consist with diagnosi of local relat epilepsi with seizur aris from the left occipit region in addit there is no evid of focal structur cerebr dysfunct in the left hemispher maximum in the pariet and tempor region which may be relat to the known tumor resect these find were communic to the primari team as they occur
