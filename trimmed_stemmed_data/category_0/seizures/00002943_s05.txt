medic depakot dilantin midazolam propofol phenobarbit introduct continu digit video eeg is perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg this section of continu eeg monitor conclud at 29 on the 29th descript of the record due to some technic issu the patient was record throughout the day with more than eeg monitor devic there are multipl ictal pattern note earli in the day with repetit seizur or persist sharp wave from the left hemispher with generous field of spread in the left mid to anterior tempor region sometim f3 by 00 in the afternoon there is relat continu homogen pattern of left frontotempor sharp wave with some doubl phase revers artifact given the craniotomi the sharp wave clear have an aftergo slow wave and can be differenti from the patient background ekg the intens of the sharp wave is 75 hz the sharp wave end abrupt at 40 of note the midazolam was discontinu at 46 after 40 the background eeg is initi mark suppress and then gradual at about 00p there is more rhythmic activ by 30 when this epoch end use slow paper speed there is veri slow focus of sharpli contour activ emerg at c3 impress this is an acut post craniotomi patient with craniotomi defect which may contribut to some of the pattern describ abov these result were discuss with the clinic team after hour on the 29th descript of the record in the initi hour of the eeg the patient is in status epilepticus with recurr seizur character by repetit ictal activ from the left frontotempor region the eeg termin abrupt at approxim 11 30 and just as that start to happen the epileptiform activ is start to abat in the earli even hour that includ this record the patient receiv the phenytoin load the depakot load at approxim 11 when the seizur have not stop the transit is made from midazolam drip high concentr inform not provid and transit to propofol is made phenobarbit is initi with load dose at approxim these load dose includ 130 mg iv push 1470 mg iv push and anoth 735 mg at the epileptiform activ is start to slow down and there are section of the record with suppress last up to second while there is clear an improv in the record there are burst of epileptiform activ eman out of burst suppress and these are identifi at at 15 again the epileptiform activ is in pronounc burst with shorter period of suppress the eeg electrod are remov at 42 for cat scan descript of the record this patient with recent status epilepticus enter relat suppress background with some rhythmic activ in the left frontocentr region note overnight on the 29th by the morn of the 30th the background eeg was quit suppress by that time the patient was on phenobarbit and propofol onli the propofol was wean around 00 and high amplitud sharp wave were note intermitt and then in burst from the left frontotempor region addit medic manag was not avail at the time of this dictat despit the craniotomi defect there doe appear to be an ictal discharg from the left hemispher at 11 38 intermitt brief seizur are note the phenobarbit and midazolam are adjust and addit record in the earli even on the 30th identifi brief burst of epileptiform activ in burst suppress pattern burst of epileptiform activ may last second but on occas includ 15 second in durat introduct continu digit video eeg monitor was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg which began on the 31st and continu on the morn of the 2nd descript of record to summar the patient narrat cours she requir treatment with multipl dose of medic she was taper off the midazolam and remain on propofol on saturday 04 30 which was discontinu on may between may and may she was manag with phenobarbit her neurolog impair improv bit in term of presenc of some cranial nerv find she remain intub and comatos without motor sign april 30 to may with the elimin of the propofol the burst suppress pattern disappear and there are intermitt burst of sharp wave may to may after propofol was discontinu burst of activ are note some of which are more prolong and some of which must be consid brief seizur note from the hemispher includ left frontal and tempor region these occur out of burst suppress pattern no clinic seizur are note the eeg on the morn of the 2nd at 30 is consider more continu although no chang in medic were made the eeg at the conclus of this dictat at 20 with more clear burst suppress pattern but out of the burst suppress pattern epileptiform activ with repetit sharp wave spike or faster frequenc activ is note primarili left frontal more than frontotempor region hr 90 bpm introduct continu digit video eeg was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg hyperventil and photic stimul are perform the patient had receiv propofol intermitt on the night of may into the morn of may and the propofol was use intermitt in the section of the record just at the begin of this eeg descript of the record over the cours of the even the patient receiv intermitt dose of ativan and at 00 throughout much of the afternoon of may there is an intermitt burst suppress pattern when there is ictal activ there are burst of high amplitud left frontal or frontotempor sharp wave in the region of the patient craniotomi by 40 on may although it is burst suppress pattern there is more epileptiform activ and there is intermitt continu burst and train of epileptiform activ are note out of the burst suppress pattern and at time it is suppress on the right but not on the left where there are frontal sharp wave or spike in the even of may the patient develop tremul of the right hand the hand is also note to be cool review of the video at the bedsid identifi tremul with the activ the tremul in the right hand note at midnight doe not correl with the epileptiform activ and in fact there is trembl artifact note which span the epileptiform activ in other word it is seen when the eeg is suppress midazolam drip is initi at 00 titrat up to mg per hour and then down to there is brief epoch at 00 where the eeg is continu and slow this is like the section as the midazolam drip is titrat upward unfortun blood pressur declin and the midazolam is reduc at midazolam drip of mg per hour the eeg is in burst suppress but there are actual some section between and mg where it is not burst suppress and it is relat continu but without promin epileptiform activ this section of the record end at 11 30 as the nurs tri to turn the midazolam complet off and the eeg start to be somewhat more continu with frontal sharp wave hr 138bpm impress abnorm eeg due to promin burst suppress pattern intermitt seizur note even out of burst suppress pattern interim clinic correl this eeg demonstr ongo mark epileptiform pattern introduct continu digit video eeg monitor was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel ekg the medic in this section of the record includ midazolam drip which is taper up and down in this 24-hour section in addit glucosamin 400 mg per day and phenobarbit are util descript of the record the major of this eeg includ burst suppress pattern which is at time continu on some occas particular in the even on may 2011 the eeg becom more continu and as it doe so burst of left frontal sharp wave are observ even when the record is much more discontinu there are intermitt left frontal or frontal tempor sharp wave or spike typic occur in burst in addit particular in the earli morn section on the may 2011 there are section where there is burst suppress pattern but signific decreas in epileptiform activ hr 114 bpm descript of the record this epoch show increas continu the right hemispher demonstr variabl quantiti of theta and delta there is left frontal spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complex as medic are adjust the epileptiform activ appear in burst around 11 00 on may 2011 paroxysm burst are note and then there is more of pattern of sustain activ note by 14 the primari activ is left frontal and those sharp wave do not necessarili build up but there are also quit promin sharp wave t3 and f7 hr 120 bpm interv impress clinic correl this section of the record demonstr an increas continu eeg unfortun it also demonstr signific more epileptiform activ although most of the time this is not demonstr prolong paroxysm burst the pattern describ abov is howev potenti an ongo ictal pattern after 11 35 introduct continu digit video eeg was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg hyperventil and photic stimul are perform the patient is intub and minim respons descript of the record frequent left frontal spike and sharp are note the overal eeg is continu although there are no clinic seizur and no definit epilept seizur there is brief build up of sharp wave and rhythmic frontal delta stimul of the patient doe not clear activ the record hr 120bpm interv impress clinic correl this section of the record demonstr an increas continu electroencephalogram the epileptiform activ is promin but is no longer evolv introduct continu digit video eeg was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg the patient midazolam was stop prior to this section of the record descript of the record much of the eeg includ pattern with frequent left frontal sharp wave there are brief section includ at 10 00 where the epileptiform activ decreas substanti although there are brief burst there are no frequent sustain ictal discharg hr impress clinic correl this continu video eeg monitor session demonstr promin epileptiform focus which appear to be abat by the end of the record
