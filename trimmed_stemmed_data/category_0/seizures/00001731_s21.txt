medic ativan phenobarbit lacosamid topamax lisinopril pantoprazol lipitor introduct continu digit video eeg monitor was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel ekg the patient has number of seizur all of which he describ as remain awak and awar throughout the seizur may includ right hemi-sensori phenomenon or right-sid shake he has some tremul on the left but is alert and can use the left hand descript of the record the background eeg is mark abnorm the activ on the right includ excess beta and is somewhat slow and disorgan the interict spike in the eeg record are primarili high amplitud polyspik and tend to have larg field of spread in the left hemispher includ posterior tempor and central tempor most seizur are quit brief some just 30 second in durat clinic they began with some activ in the central region which may or may not be associ with suppress of the high-amplitud spike on the right there is often period of time befor there is clear clinic chang there is theta note from the right hemispher dure the seizur and in these seizur use differ montag there is promin spread in the left hemispher there are pushbutton well-defin electrograph seizur overal hr 72 bpm interv impress clinic correl by the end of the eeg record the epileptiform activ was improv descript of the record random wake and sleep in wake the background eeg is somewhat slow from the right hemispher the left hemispher demonstr arrhythm delta activ with high amplitud left posterior tempor spike complex clinic seizur are note reliabl with the patient and nurs and there are more than 20 pushbutton event approxim 23 all 30-60 second in durat they are character by focal motor activ on the right hemibodi electrocardiograph there is buzz of mix and 10 hz activ in the left hemispher includ the central region there are hand of seizur that when seizur occur as pair where there is bit more of rhythmic delta pattern that preced it so if there are seizur togeth the second is not as well defin as the first mani of the seizur occur in sleep some seem to have beta buzz earli on in the seizur hr 80 bpm impress this 24-hour section of eeg monitor was remark for larg number of seizur the most disturb seem to be have been those that occur in sleep but in fact they were also seen in the earli even hour as well there may have been other event that look like seizur but were not associ with pushbutton event and those occur with the patient off camera so it is difficult to know if these were clinic signific or not of note there are other section in the record where the patient seem to have had seizur while sleep which did not seem to disrupt his sleep at all descript of the record the interict eeg continu to demonstr focal slow from the left hemispher with left posterior tempor sharp wave multipl seizur are identifi in the 24 hour section includ in wake and sleep the patient doe not seem to wake up for all of them stage ii sleep includ the 00 to 00 section are promin the nurs were awar of the seizur in sleep these seizur seem to be begin with burst of fast activ almost some 10 to hz which is pick up veri close to the midlin the activ is realli veri promin at cz where it is 10 hz discharg this evolv to more of theta frequenc pattern and then the posterior tempor spike continu most seizur are under 30 second in durat hr 80 bpm introduct continu digit video eeg monitor was perform at bedsid dure section of the record the patient has approxim 40 simpl partial seizur all character by involuntari movement on the right other seizur can occur out of sleep but in this 24-hour section almost all the seizur seem to wake him up and are associ with right-sid shake the seizur have variabl pattern but all local to the left hemispher some seem to start with beta buzz in the left central region other with more higher amplitud spike and wave activ the interict activ includ pattern with excess beta and theta from the right hemispher the left hemispher demonstr delta and the epileptiform activ interict is more of polyspik activ in the left posterior tempor region or central pariet region the seizur had improv hr 80 bpm introduct continu video eeg monitor is perform for this individu he has mani seizur typic character by right-sid shake descript of the record the major of the seizur occur on the even of the 26th with multipl repetit focal seizur asid from this he demonstr stage sleep with vertex wave complex and spindl by the later section of the record on the 27th the patient has more signific section where he is awak do well and then drift off to sleep this piec of eeg conclud at 24 on the 27th introduct continu video eeg record is perform in the long-term monitor unit use 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg this section of the record captur 00 to 00 period the patient has relat few clinic seizur in the overnight record there are some subclin rhythmic beta discharg from the left hemispher left occipit tempor polyspik activ is note as well as some polyspik activ in sleep with more generous field of spread throughout the left hemispher includ left central region clinic event are note with beta buzz and sensori seizur at 28 and more typic clinic seizur at 10 59 this seizur is character by tremul in the right arm and leg the onset of this seizur is not as well defin as some of the other it seem to come out of some period slow and sharp activ in the left hemispher and that activ is present for about 30 second befor the clinic shake stop like most of the patient seizur it is approxim 30 second in durat addit seizur are note at 11 52 addit seizur at 12 42 08 16 31 07 46 the 00 to 00 section is again remark for signific seizur which are focal seizur as was the patient pattern throughout this hospit seizur seem to stop around 30 in the morn addit seizur are note at 00 and 10 00 impress clinic correl this long-term video eeg monitor was remark for mani seizur with worsen of the total number of seizur over the weekend but gradual improv toward the end of the long-term monitor record of note the even hour seem to be the most promin with veri promin seizur at that time this pattern is similar to previous pattern for this individu
