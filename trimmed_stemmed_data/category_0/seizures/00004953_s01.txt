one channel of ekg the child is intub and this is bedsid record there are no clinic note regard the patient clinic condit or descript of seizur and none are enter into the document descript of the record this continu video eeg monitor begin at 15 50 the background eeg includ mix frequenc pattern with bit more arrhythm delta in the posterior region there is high amplitud spike and slow wave complex from the left hemispher maximum in the occipit region but with generous field of spread in addit there are occasion spike and slow wave complex pick up in the right hemispher again with generous field of spread in the centrotempor region with variabl maximum there are no push button event to indic that the clinic team identifi seizur at 23 42 there are burst of frontal delta the record from 1500 to 2300 hour show increas amount of beta the spike continu the child is seen on the video he is lie supin flaccid and motionless pentobarbit 65 mg is given at midnight produc frontal delta and increas amount of pentobarbit are given at 00 am 00 am and 00 am as well as 00 am the record continu to demonstr delta pattern with generous amount of beta after midnight when the child receiv the pentobarb the epileptiform activ decreas substanti look through the stellat detect file there is an event at 01 54 this demonstr an increas discontinu pattern with flatten and then there is burst of fast activ which is most intens at the midlin and on the right there are no clinic correl note with this burst around this time occasion discret spike and spike and slow wave or sharp wave are note from the right central region and the left occipit region the next stellat detect is at 41 and demonstr intermitt burst of fast activ from the central region left or right in background almost in burst suppress but not quit there are intermitt burst of cerebr activ as well as occasion focal spike from the right central or left occipit region no clinic sign or symptom accompani this stellat detect intermitt record from 00 am through the next morn includ the stellat detect at 41 59 02 05 22 and 35 these pattern are similar to the entir pattern which is one of almost discontinuous-typ pattern with burst of approxim three second of fast activ which is maximum in the central region sometim bit more on the left and sometim on the right this is follow by burst of mix frequenc chaotic cerebr activ sometim with sharp wave and sometim follow by an attenu the attenu or suppress may be asymmetr and may be depress on the right or left side in addit the burst of fast activ typic preced the burst of cerebr activ but on occas follow it the typic durat is approxim three second by 21 am the eeg demonstr more continu pattern with frontal delta again no clinic sign are note and the pattern at this time demonstr less in the way of epileptiform activ it is difficult to correl this with the infus of the barbitur as the child is receiv phenobarbit and pentobarbit at the same time howev the child would have receiv 100 mg of phenobarbit at 00 am and there is brief hiatus at that time with the pentobarb at 48 the eeg becom more discontinu this would follow the administr of the pentobarb which at that point has increas from 65 ml hr to 78 ml hr no clinic sign or symptom can be seen on the video but there is clear discontinu pattern with beta buzz from the left or right frontocentr region long-term eeg monitor februari 2006 medic acyclovir pentobarbit and phenobarbit the pentobarbit drip start at 78 ml hr to 04 ml hr introduct the nurs observ indic that at 00 am there was an episod with left arm and left eye twitch and the patient receiv 65 mg of pentobarbit bolus it is not possibl to see the eye twitch or the examin of the patient dure the seizur on the video the next record seizur is at 00 pm on the 7th event time 13 54 the background eeg is mark suppress it is near featureless the child father is at the bedsid when there is cerebr activ it is sharpli contour and the occasion right central sharp wave is seen in the background there is the intermitt three-second burst of beta identifi from the right hemispher again last approxim three second at this point in time the same burst of fast activ is seen but it slow to approxim alpha frequenc at 10 hz it is not possibl to see if there is clinic correl with this addit burst are seen at 13 58 with two burst in close approxim extend video is review at 00 am there is parent at the bedsid who doe not appear to observ ani chang in the child behavior and noth is note on the video in the hour that follow there are intermitt burst last approxim few second in durat of what is now alpha frequenc activ most intens in the right hemispher there are intermitt spike and slow wave complex from the left occipit region and in the right hemispher particular the centrotempor region with generous field of spread the burst of beta disrupt the overal suppress pattern the nurs indic that the pentobarb dose vari between 04 ml hr at 30 am to 39 ml hr at 00 pm in this section of the record there doesn seem to be substanti chang in term of the background which demonstr an intermitt discontinu pattern and the three-second period of beta frequenc activ the pentobarbit continu at rate of 78 ml hr mg kg hr at the close of the record the child doe appear to be comatos but the burst of fast activ are seen in this context hr 150 to 180 bpm long-term eeg monitor februari 2006 to februari 2006 introduct this section of the record run from 42 to 13 25 continu video eeg monitor is perform in the neonat icu use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg the child is current in pentobarb coma with high dose phenobarbit he is intub and comatos review of the video doe not identifi clinic correl descript of the record the background eeg is at time discontinu and at other time veri low voltag in this low voltag suppress background there are intermitt spike and slow wave complex identifi from either hemispher includ the left occipit or right centrotempor there are intermitt burst of fast activ these are ident to the previous describ burst of beta frequenc activ but are now primarili alpha frequenc activ last typic three second in durat these appear with three differ pattern the first pattern is that seen in the previous epoch with burst of fast activ either from both hemispher or from one hemispher or the other follow by arrhythm delta in addit there are occasion burst of activ which can be seen in one hemispher with transit to the other hemispher and the burst of delta may preced or follow the burst of fast activ there are also some burst with more of bilater represent they are follow by the chaotic delta and in some occas there is some spike pick up in the left hemispher befor the event is maximum on the left with the use of sensit of uv per minut the eeg doe appear to be less continu with rhythmic slow and frequent epileptiform discharg there is some variabl in the degre of suppress and the frequenc of the burst of fact activ but there is no sustain period longer than sever minut without these like epileptiform discharg long-term eeg monitor februari 2006 to februari 2006 continu introduct dure this section of the record the observ was that the child was comatos there are no report of twitch in this portion of the record descript of the record the eeg start at 1400 hour in place of the previous describ burst of beta and alpha frequenc activ there are burst of rhythmic activ which are monomorph in the rang of to 10 hz last three and at time 10 second these gradual decreas and are less appar by 00 am in the 00 am record that follow there are frequent high amplitud spike and slow wave complex in veri irrit brain but there are no discern clinic seizur and there are no addit burst of that rhythmic monomorph activ that was initi beta then slow to alpha this section of the record conclud at 10 30 am on the morn of the 9th the pattern at the conclus includ burst of high amplitud spike and slow wave activ from the right hemispher particular the centrotempor region and the left occipit it is intermitt discontinu with an irritative-look pattern but there are no sustain burst of that rhythmic activ seen previous long-term eeg monitor februari 2006 to februari 10 2006 medic ceftriaxon phenytoin and midazalam start at 00 pm phenobarbit introduct this continu video eeg monitor begin at 11 00 am and continu to the morn of the 10th dure this section the patient receiv phenytoin in the morn and was start on vers drip at mg kg hr one clinic event character by eye flutter was report at 2200 hour but could not be identifi subsequ descript of the record in the earli portion of the record the background eeg demonstr pattern which is intermitt suppress with occasion sharp wave from the left occipit and right centrotempor region there is some variabl in the record with some portion of the record more suppress than other there are also burst of sharpli contour activ the vers is start at 00 pm this is associ with an attenu of the background there is decreas in the sharp wave note in the background and no clinic seizur were record at the close of the record the eeg is low voltag not entir discontinu with mark decreas in the fast activ dure this section of the record none of the patient burst of fast activ were identifi hr 122 bpm long-term eeg monitor februari 10 2006 to februari 11 2006 medic phenytoin midazalam with dose rang from to phenobarbit and other introduct continu video eeg monitor is perform at the bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg the medic printout doe not tag all of the medic chang but at 13 18 the vers was decreas to mg kg hr the patient remain intub and poor respons descript of the record in the initi background there is mix frequenc pattern the pattern includ arrhythm slow delta and smaller amount of theta in the initi portion of the record there is some subtl variabl with stimuli there is also bit of asymmetri with bit more faster frequenc activ on the right over the cours of time the vers dose is reduc to mg hr at 16 28 53 it is reduc again at 18 27 29 it isn until after midnight on the morn of the 11th that the spike realli increas and there is an increas in epileptiform activ in the left occipit region by the close of the record on the morn of the 11th the eeg is continu there is left occipit spike seen and some ekg artifact the overal background is rich in delta with some alpha and theta frequenc activ and some fast activ clinic seizur was report at 10 00 am which is not includ in this piec of the record which end at 23 long-term eeg monitor februari 11 2006 to februari 12 2006 introduct in this portion of the record the child is heavili sedat the record start on the morn of the 11th at that time the vers drip had been increas to becaus of clinic event descript of the record this section of the eeg is remark for frequent left occipit spike it is uniqu in that there is more fast activ from the right posterior region and this is the first time that right posterior tempor sharp wave has been identifi the record is variabl with portion of the record demonstr more delta than other this section is remark for few comment although there were later report that this child had clinic event dure this section of the record as the record continu at 14 39 there is more fast activ and bit more asymmetri with bit less delta from the right on the morn of the 11th there is an event describ by the nurs as seizur the tech make comment at 10 10 am the video is review which show the nurs at the bedsid the video fail to identifi ani eeg chang that would be refer to this and the child doe not seem to be move the child face is not well defin but there isn ani arm movement right hand circular movement at 11 00 am on the 11th were not visual by the video and there was no eeg correl by 11 00 pm on the 11th the background is more symmetr richer in faster frequenc activ right arm movement of the child is note at midnight although there is an individu at the bedsid the child is be suction which might account for the movement the nurs had observ that the behavior that they were call seizur were stimulus sensit the eeg record on the morn of the 12th demonstr pattern rich in faster frequenc activ as well as theta there are frequent spike and slow wave complex left occipit right posterior tempor and fewer in the right central region there are no definit burst of alpha and beta frequenc activ long-term eeg monitor februari 12 2006 to februari 13 2006 medic ceftriaxon phenytoin fentanyl midazalam and phenobarbit vecuronium is given at 10 19 46 descript of the record the eeg in this portion of the record is continu rich in theta and delta frequenc activ with fast activ in this section of the record there is epileptiform activ includ right occipit or right posterior tempor as well as left but there are few of the burst of fast activ although there were report that the child had seizur on this day they are not mark in the eeg and in that the behavior were not associ with chang in the eeg it is not possibl to identifi them even with the video camera as the record continu it is not clear when the dose of vers was increas there is some twitch seen at 20 38 and the nurs are work at the bedsid at 20 41 by 22 54 the burst of fast activ have return last now approxim two second not so clear associ or follow with delta these are relat synchron in both hemispher are this time there are no clinic note regard whether or not these were consid signific but by midnight it appear that the vers drip may have been increas as the background is slower than previous identifi and is sometim discontinu by 00 am the eeg is increas continu howev there are also focal spike and the burst of the fact activ are seen in what is now somewhat continu record this would also be consid new pattern for this child at 10 38 infus with dilantin is given to the patient right hand movement are note by the nurs at 18 36 27 this was somewhat difficult to discern on the video but no eeg correl right hand and arm movement were note on the 12th at 27 and 38 with more pronounc motor activ and more sustain seizur again this was without clear correl howev in this case it is quit possibl that there was an under ictal discharg not otherwis seen ditto 45 long-term eeg monitor februari 13 2006 to februari 14 2006 descript of the record the eeg on the morn of the 13th continu to show the discontinu pattern with fast activ also there is fine tremor of the right hand the eeg reveal no clear eeg correl but muscl artifact which is sustain and may veri well have an under ictal pattern not well visual by scalp eeg ditto 43 52 and 21 there is clinic seizur that occur at 12 20 05 after the nurs move the patient this can be review on the video the review begin at 18 at that time the eeg show somewhat discontinu pattern with beta burst and occipit spike the nurs enter at 12 20 00 she start by touch the child on the left at 12 20 10 as she is touch the patient at 12 20 11 the eeg chang from what is higher amplitud pattern with mix delta and theta and the intermitt burst of beta there is an attenu in frequenc and it look like there is fast activ out of the right hemispher immedi as she start touch him the right arm start move in an almost circular fashion almost semi-purpos fashion the nurs note that the child is turn to the right there is some frontal delta and some spike in the occipit region bilater the eeg seem to chang for the third time in this seizur at 20 20 41 with more muscl artifact the circular movement are note with the right hand and there is anoth movement in the left hand the right arm is down and the left hand is more flex and extend not entir like fenster postur but with that suggest dure this time the eeg doesn have clear ictal pattern there may be some under spike in the left posterior tempor region seizur time 12 20 on monday februari 13th the motor activ continu as long as the child has tactil stimul at 12 31 there is what may be artifact but may also be part of this child unusu epileptiform appear out of the right hemispher with combin of fast activ and muscl artifact by 16 57 the eeg has return to it usual pattern with burst of beta activ and the occipit spike with less in the way of the right occipit spike or the other epileptiform featur there are other portion of the record where muscl artifact is seen includ 19 57 this is long event and seem to start with handl of the patient it begin with circular movement of the right hand muscl artifact on the right and right eye deviat the occipit spike is not seen at that time there is somewhat of an increas in faster frequenc activ in the overal background but there is no clear ictal pattern at 19 59 19 the nurs are handl the patient dure the seizur and the arm continu to move dilantin infus long-term eeg monitor februari 14 2006 to februari 15 2006 introduct continu video eeg monitor is perform at the bedsid in this section of the record no clinic seizur are note the patient is on vers drip of descript of the record as the record begin the background is continu with mix frequenc pattern at 12 51 21 epileptiform activ is appar in background that is slower than the initi morn record in addit as the record continu over the cours of the 14th there are occasion burst of fast activ occur with burst now under three second more typic on the order of two second maximum at the midlin with some occasion predisposit to the right or the left side is seen these no longer seem to be associ with the same burst of delta that were previous identifi this section of the record is record in two piec the first piec conclud at 16 21 and at that time left quick burst of fast activ are seen but the left occipit spike is note again no clinic correl are note the addit section of the record continu to show child who is unrespons the late afternoon and overnight record again show relat frequent left occipit spike and wave complex as well as the occasion burst of fast activ at time the record is somewhat discontinu and in other portion of the record the record is richer in mix beta and delta but at some point when it is relat rich in this activ there is both frequent left occipit spike and the burst of beta hr 120 bpm impress this prolong video eeg monitor is remark for an unusu form of status epilepticus with what appear to be clinic sometim on the video and sometim by eye wit account an unusu seizur which at time was stimulus sensit at time mark and at other time more subtl with circular movement of the right hand or clonic movement of the right side of the bodi it was almost fenster postur of the left hand and or elev of the left leg these activ were sometim associ with eye flutter after the administr of benzodiazepin or barbitur burst of fast activ were seen which seem to be ictal in natur preced or follow by burst of delta epileptiform foci left occipit right central and as the record continu right posterior tempor clinic correl this eeg is support of veri mark under epileptiform disord the behavior without clear clinic correl do appear to be seizur particular as some subtl behavior seem to have an under chang in the eeg of note this activ respond earli on to vers or to high dose barbitur but then seem to breakthrough
