reason for eeg refractori seizur medic tegretol and depakot as well as keppra introduct long-term eeg was perform use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with anterior tempor and singl lead ekg electrod the patient was record dure wake and sleep no activ procedur were perform technic difficulti at about 11 the patient start becom agit and move and disconnect multipl of his lead and by in the morn unfortun the major of his lead were lost and the record could not be continu this is onli 17-hour record descript of the record the record open to diffus slow background with posterior domin rhythm that reach at best 6-7 hz which is reactiv to eye open there is some frontal central beta the patient doe appear to go into sleep but the sleep architectur is not typic no activ procedur were perform abnorm discharg there are rare bifront sharp wave seen in sleep which appear to be maxim at possibl f4 with prefront field general slow at 5-7 hz seen continu throughout the record seizur three seizur were record dure this long-term monitor the first one occur at 10 15 in the morn clinic the patient is lay in bed and appear to grunt and sudden jerk it last for what appear to be 20 second electrograph at the begin of the seizur there is predomin frontal beta discharg with associ attenu that appear in both frontal region and appear to continu as it is obscur by muscl artifact afterward there appear to be some slow in the frontal region although the slow is difficult to distinguish from it usual background the second seizur occur at 41 last for 30 second this one occur from sleep the patient sudden move his right arm and the right hand clear becom dyston sudden the right arm then becom forc extend he grunt and sudden the seizur stop the nurs came into the room but did not test him until the seizur had clinic and electrograph stop electrograph at onset there appear to be again frontal predomin beta discharg and diffus attenu which continu to evolv and then get obscur by muscl artifact after the event there appear to be some more promin diffus slow seizur number occur at 51 about 40 second after wake up the patient sudden grunt and his right arm move underneath the cover and cannot be seen this last about 30 second and then sudden stop electrograph again there is frontal beta discharg which is associ with diffus attenu and appear to continu to evolv and then no longer seen due to muscl artifact after the seizur appear to clinic end there seem to be some diffus slow heart rate is 86 impress abnorm eeg due to seizur like aris from either frontal lobe in addit to diffus slow clinic correl this eeg is consist with diagnosi of local relat epilepsi with seizur like aris from the frontal region with unclear later the right arm dyston postur in one of them suggest possibl left frontal onset although this cannot be certain these seizur were communic to the team as the eeg was perform last there is evid of moder diffus cerebr dysfunct which is nonspecif with regard to etiolog
