medic ativan dilantin introduct continu video eeg monitor is perform at the bedsid in the icu use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg this is 48-hour studi descript of the record as the trace open the patient is in the icu the nurs is work with the technologist there is seizur seen at 16 45 48 the patient is not in great focus on the video but he seem to have subtl jerk of his head with the onset of the activ the audio is not work but review the video there doe seem to be clinic correl with jerk of the head when the video can be seen but for much of the time the tech is talk to someon els obscur the patient and the audio is off so it is not possibl to know when the clinic team recogn the seizur the first seizur is three minut in durat and begin with right frontal sharp and slow wave activ and repetit spike pattern it last three minut with clear frequenc evolut as well as tempor spread in the right hemispher by 16 46 55 it is involv the left hemispher by 16 47 25 the clinic team may be note the activ although it is difficult to tell they are move the electrod and review the video it is hard to see the patient move at that time the clinic team move away from the camera at 16 49 and at that point the general approxim to hz spike and wave activ pattern is seen with signific muscl and movement artifact maximum on the left but with clear involv of the left the activ demonstr frequenc evolut from to hz and then slow and end abrupt with postict attenu in term of involv of the left hemispher the occipit region seem to be involv more on the right more posterior than the anterior region seizur time 16 51 18 the patient is at the bedsid and the tech are work with the electrod the seizur again begin with right frontal high amplitud spike and slow wave activ the initi onset is littl bit more subtl and in this longer discharg approxim minut there is littl in the way of clinic sign time sampl dure this section of the record there are right frontal sharp and slow wave complex with pattern of intrahemispher asymmetri and disrupt of faster frequenc activ from the right hemispher compar to the left there is also more arrhythm delta activ from the right than the left and the phase revers for much of the epileptiform activ is right frontal although some is maximum at t4 and there is generous field of spread at fp2 f4 for the primari frontal spike as the record continu there is clear improv in the background from the left hemispher with the appear of more alpha and theta frequenc activ over time the background from the right demonstr some variabl but in the initi hour follow the two seizur everi ten-second epoch demonstr some sharp wave by the earli morn hour the sharp wave on the right are begin to wane becom more subtl in the background slower amplitud and transit from spike to sharp in term of durat the first 24-hour time sampl demonstr gradual abat of the sharp wave which have transit to primarili right frontal sharp wave long-term monitor septemb 2006 to septemb 10 2006 descript of the record the record on 09 09 demonstr gradual diminut fade of the epileptiform activ from the right frontal region the overal background from the left demonstr some variabl with some portion be much slower than the right by the close of the second 24-hour section on the morn of the 10th the epileptiform activ is clear fade from the right hemispher although the intrahemispher asymmetri persist hr 88 bpm impress clinic correl this 48-hour eeg monitor is remark for two seizur in the first 24-hour initi quit promin epileptiform activ from the right hemispher fade by the morn of the 10th intrahemispher asymmetri with greater slow on the right
