reason for studi seizur medic dilantin introduct long term eeg was perform from octob 20 2012 to octob 22 2012 use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterior tempor and singl lead ekg the patient was record dure respons activ procedur were not perform technic difficulti none descript of the record the record open to diffus slow background with no normal posterior domin rhythm or frontal central beta there is no normal sleep architectur no activ procedur were perform overal there is general delta with at time overrid burst of theta burst at time there is also slight diffus attenu abnorm discharg focal sharp wave seen continu with frontal predomin at f7 f3 that appear to move more posterior more central and then more posterior toward c3 and p3 at frequenc of 1-2 hz rhythmic and monomorph consist with period later epileptiform discharg pled general slow wave at 2-4 hz at an amplitud of 20-40 mv seen continu throughout the record at time there is an overrid beta that occur infrequ and also some diffus burst suppress for less than to second seizur on 10 21 2012 at 43am and on 10 22 2012 at 01am there were seizur seen on the eeg with sudden increas in frequenc to beta discharg of about 13-14 hz maxim over the left frontal f3 electrod and c3 central electrod which continu to increas in frequenc and in about minut there appear to be an electrograph correl clinic correl with right facial twitch this discharg continu for about 1-2 minut and then sudden stop and subsid it remain main over the left hemispher and doe not appear to spread to the right on 10 22 2012 at 24 the patient develop similar rhythmic beta discharg which increas in frequenc and appear to settl over the left frontal f3 and move central c3 region howev remain onli over the left hemispher this seizur last about minut and has no clinic correl to it impress abnorm eeg due to left frontal central seizur two with focal motor correl in the right face as well as one electrograph in addit to left frontal central pled and diffus slow clinic correl this eeg reveal left frontal central seizur two with focal motor correl and one electrograph seizur which is consist with the diagnosi of local relat epilepsi in addit there is evid of left frontal central acut structur dysfunct and irrit last there is evid of diffus cerebr dysfunct which is nonspecif but mayb due at least in part to medic effect these find were report to the primari team after review of the eeg
