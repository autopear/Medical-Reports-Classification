introduct continu video eeg is perform in the unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg seizur time 23 30 38 the patient is drowsi and alert from sleep an arous is seen at 22 31 38 she take off the cover reach for the push button hand are rais to her side and she start flap them from side to side there may be veri subtl asymmetri with perhap bit more fluid flap from the left than the right tachycardia is seen with associ with the flap at 22 33 08 she is flap and although the video isn optim in term of the facial automat it look as if there may be some oral automat associ with this when the nurs come in at 22 32 11 the patient can look at them and when they ask if she is okay she nod yes at 22 32 38 immedi as the event end either the nurs or the patient say that the seizur is over the eeg dure this event doe have an electrograph signatur it is best review with notch filter on and high frequenc filter of 35 there is an arous at 22 31 41 with suggest of sharp wave at that time with eye movement there is like an under pair of sharp wave at t1 as well just befor the patient start with arm flap although there is some movement artifact there is high amplitud rhythmic delta from the left tempor region and this can clear be delin from 22 31 43 through 22 31 57 at this point as the motor activ is more vigor the eeg is obscur look at the left frontocentr region there aren definit frontocentr spike wave note despit the movement artifact there is this focal delta from the left tempor region with generous field of spread and attenu of the alpha there seem to be general background slow at 22 32 40 and at 22 32 47 the seizur seem to be over with littl in the way of postict chang random wake and sleep stage ii sleep is character by vertex wave and spindl the major of the epileptiform discharg in this section of the record are in stage ii sleep long-term eeg monitor septemb 12-13 2006 introduct continu video eeg is perform in the unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg the patient initi report that she did not have ani seizur but with review of the eeg monitor data one event was note and was review with the patient descript of the record in wake the background eeg includ well-organ pattern with to 10 hz posterior domin rhythm there is great deal of eye artifact pick up in wake random wakefuless and sleep two artifact are seen in the earli portion of the morn this is also seen at mealtim in wake there are rare spike and slow wave complex identifi particular when the awak record is observ in the late even or nighttim hour stage ii sleep is character by vertex wave complex and spindl epileptiform activ can be seen in the transit to and from sleep and sleep seem to be fragment for this individu seizur time 23 22 34 the patient is drowsi in the transit to and from wake to earli drowsi the seizur begin with left anteriotempor t1 maximum spike and slow wave complex identifi at 23 22 34 follow by an arous at 23 22 38 behavior this seizur is similar to the seizur 24 hour prior to this the patient take off the cover and begin flap her arm from side to side as if to cool herself down look at the video she seem to remain awak and alert it is not possibl to see ani oral automat she also seem to have relat purpos behavior at one point she doesn slap on the right but she doe slap on the left howev it doesn seem as if she has dyston postur on the right she also has altern movement of the arm the behavior is over at 23 33 44 the seizur seem to be over at the same time with seizur durat of one minut ten second eeg correl for this seizur includ the initi left anteriotempor spike follow by arous the flap movement produc great deal of artifact howev even prior to the flap movement there is rhythmic to hz delta pick up from the left tempor region begin at 23 22 39 and continu although there is artifact at 22 50 to 23 22 60 with the use of filter it is clear that in this seizur despit the movement artifact there is left frontocentr f3 c3 high amplitud spike complex which is identifi as earlier as 23 23 09 with period of approxim hz use the filter the spike activ can be seen although it doesn clear evolv and it doesn correl with the rate at which she flap her arm it doe seem to increas in intens and then to dissip at 23 23 36 care review of the time sampl that follow suggest that there is some subtl in the left tempor region that follow the left central spike activ was not identifi later on in the record and the patient drift off to sleep five minut later the nurs enter and check the patient blood pressur and temperatur tachycardia is seen in associ with the seizur onli and the heart rate seem to increas at the begin of the discharg long-term eeg monitor septemb 13 2006 medic dilantin and topiram introduct continu video eeg monitor is perform at the bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg the patient is awak she report no clinic seizur dure this time descript of the record this section of the record demonstr an awak pattern with signific chew artifact most of the interpret record includ an awak pattern with lamdba no epileptiform featur are identifi in the awak record there is great deal of eye movement artifact hr 80-104 bpm overal impress clinic correl eeg monitor over day is remark for interict high amplitud left anteriotempor spike and slow wave complex seen primarili in the transit to drowsi but in wake and sleep two unusu seizur the seizur had definit eeg signatur despit artifact and begin with left anteriotempor spike they seem to have evolv left tempor delta and one of the two seizur had left frontocentr spike at the end of it behavior the seizur were character by minim impair of awar but with motor activ which the patient herself describ as respons to the somat symptom that she feel she recal feel hot dure the seizur and henc she recal flap her arm back and forth to cool herself look at the video dure the first seizur there may well have been subtl impair of awar with that seizur and there may have also been facial automat
