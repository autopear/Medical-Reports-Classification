medic dilantin other introduct continu video eeg is perform in the lab use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg random wake time 13 33 the patient is awak and cooper in her bed she has near continu rhythmic delta activ despit signific movement and other artifact this seem to be maximum in the tempor region right greater than left with right anterior tempor sharp and slow wave activ when the patient is abl to rest comfort this is promin but if she move about it becom more difficult to defin seizur date time 12 03 23 19 the patient is asleep in sleep there is near continu right tempor focal slow with sharp wave the sharp wave are in train in sleep the activ start out with continu focal delta from the right tempor region with generous field of spread and frequent sharp and slow wave activ as the activ continu some of it seem to spread to involv the left tempor region the patient remain asleep through this relat prolong discharg with brief arous at 23 20 47 at 23 20 57 again brief alert is identifi by the eeg with eye movement and intermitt posterior domin rhythm the patient is briefli awak at 23 19 18 at 23 19 38 again the same rhythmic repetit sharp wave and rhythmic right tempor delta is identifi by 23 22 38 the activ seem to be spread to the left tempor region there is an arous associ with this the arous seem to termin the epileptiform activ and none of the typic clinic correl that were seen with the other seizur with moan brief stiffen and postur on the left with circular movement on the right were seen by 23 24 29 this same rhythmic right tempor slow and sharp activ has return this remain through until the close of the epoch at 23 28 seizur date time 13 03 19 and 22 08 am the patient is asleep there is nurs at the bedsid and the nurs has note that intermitt the patient appear to be confus dure the cours of the night but doe not realli understand how to test the patient at 21 there is delta activ in the t1-t2 electrod bilater the patient seem to be in veri light stage of sleep at 21 20 the patient stir from sleep she is sleep on her left side she moan and lift her head she look to the right she make circular movement with her right arm and her left arm remain postur as was seen in other seizur despit signific amount of muscl and movement artifact underneath this there is rhythmic activ by 21 39 there is clear-cut ictal activ and this includ hz activ which is identifi in the tempor region becaus of the electrod artifact describ abov it is not adequ local the patient is lie back she is not move the left arm until 21 48 when she doe move the left arm the left hand is in clench postur she sit up at 22 51 the nurs rub the patient shoulder but doesn seem to realiz that the patient has had seizur the patient lie down and drift off to sleep the eeg at 24 40 demonstr diffus high amplitud delta compat with postict state descript of the record dure this portion of the record the patient has had some seizur earlier in the day she doesn recal the seizur and she is somewhat slight confus prior to the onset of the seizur seizur date time 13 03 17 08 as the seizur begin to trace the patient is off camera she has the same vocal as seen in previous seizur at 17 08 20 unfortun at the start of the seizur the eeg becom obscur with muscl and movement artifact which last 17 second in durat even with the use of hff the eeg is difficult to resolv but there doe appear to be some rhythmic to hz activ in the t2-t4 electrod seen as earli as 17 08 26 by 17 08 37 there is more clear-cut ictal pattern there is rhythmic repetit alpha theta frequenc activ which is intens on the right mid-to-anterior tempor region and slower frequenc activ to hz from the left tempor region this activ is clear maximum in the tempor region but doe involv the right central pariet region at 17 08 43 the patient remain off camera throughout the seizur by 17 08 50 both hemispher demonstr rhythmic to hz activ most intens in the tempor region the activ seem to be slow bit by 17 09 at 17 09 20 it is clear slow to delta frequenc activ in the t1-t2 electrod the seizur appear to be over by 17 09 40 for total seizur durat of approxim minut 20 second in the postict section the patient remain off camera the background show signific slow as well as artifact by 17 10 39 she is success remov her electrod which was an ident behavior to her other seizur no addit viabl record is possibl to identifi after this there are remain electrod seen but the qualiti of the record is compromis hr 96 bpm impress for ltm abnorm continu video eeg monitor due to multipl complex partial seizur with similar behavior correl but without clear scalp later or local the seizur were general stereotyp in term of complex partial in term of the behavior howev unfortun becaus of the stiffen the initi 10 to 15 second were obscur when there is scalp later or local the local seem to be right tempor and the later behavior would support focus from the right hemispher although the earli behavior didn alway identifi this with either moan or on one occas sit up abrupt and clench of the hand independ right anterior tempor spike and slow wave activ which increas dramat in the time around the patient seizur at point continu right tempor focal slow particular around the time of the patient seizur occasion left tempor spike and slow wave activ and occasion left tempor focal slow particular around the time that this patient has experienc seizur clinic correl this trace support partial mechan for epilepsi
