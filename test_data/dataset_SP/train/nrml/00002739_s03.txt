CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old right-handed woman with epilepsy since age 13 with 
a seizure at 5 a.m. this morning. 
MEDICATIONS: None 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. 
The patient declined hyperventilation. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is asleep. When 
maximally awake, a 9.25 Hz alpha rhythm is observed, but she drifts back into stage I 
and stage II sleep. Hypersynchronous bursts of theta are observed as she drifts in and 
out of sleep. In the transition to sleep, there are a handful of right anterior temporal 
discrete sharp waves. They are picked up just so ever slightly on the left. They are 
really maximum on the right. They occur in couplets. While they have the simple 
morphology of a benign variant, they are seen too frequently. In addition, as the record 
continues, the higher amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes 
are observed as are rate higher amplitude sharp and slow wave complexes from the left 
anterior temporal region. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II 
sleep and briefly when the patient arouses produces scant driving. 
HR: 50 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Independent, primarily right but also left, anterior temporal spike and slow 
wave complexes some of which are polyspike and slow wave complexes. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for 
epilepsy. No seizures were recorded. Also, this EEG is similar to prior EEGs.
