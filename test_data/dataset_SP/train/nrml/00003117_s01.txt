CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 76-year-old woman who presented with syncopal episodes.  Patient fell, hit her head, and became somnolent.  CT scan identified cerebellar stroke.   History of hypertension, diabetes, large left cerebellar infarct, and hypercephalus. 
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Heparin, Protonix, Hydralazine, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. There are brief portions of the record where there is a discernable 9 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally, but the overall background is abnormal. There are intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity, which are more prominent in the posterior regions. Some are higher amplitude on the left, but more are higher amplitude on the right. They are not entirely synchronous.  There are also occasional frontal triphasic waves, which are slightly asymmetric and there are a handful of left temporal sharp waves. There is a dynamic pattern with waxing and waning of the background seen spontaneously throughout. Some portions of the record demonstrate more of the bursts of slowing, others demonstrate less.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal irregular delta.
	Intermittent generalized background slowing. 
	Triphasic waves.
	Left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: It is important to correlate this EEG with this patientâ€™s imaging and pre-cerebellar stroke baseline, as well as the possibility of concomitant toxic or metabolic factors.  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG raises the possibility of both metabolic factors and a bihemispheric process
