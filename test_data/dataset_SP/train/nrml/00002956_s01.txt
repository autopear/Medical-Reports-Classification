	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	43-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 8, no seizures at the present time, past history of noncompliance.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin,  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG in wakefulness includes a great deal of muscle movement artifact, but there is also a well defined, 10 hertz alpha rhythm of 30-50 microvolts. There is some sharply contoured theta observed in the background with a suspicious sharp wave seen early on which is difficult to localize. During hyperventilation there is an increase in amplitude, as well as an increase in activity at
the vertex again. With the use of a circle montage, there is again this question of a vertex  sharp wave observed when the patient has not reached the appropriate stages of sleep in which vertex pathology is normally seen. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. In addition, there is a bit of shifting slowing seen around that time in the centrotemporal regions.
	HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Intermittent bursts of background slowing and disorganization.
	2.	Central sharp wave.
