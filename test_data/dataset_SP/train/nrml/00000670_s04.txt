CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male with longstanding refractory epilepsy, now with crescendo seizures, seizure-related fall, and complaint of left-sided numbness.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient reports no seizures during this portion of the record. Reviewing the data, no clinical or electrographic seizures occurred.  
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  In the overnight sleep record, there are occasional left temporal spike and slow wave complexes.  No generalized epileptiform discharges are seen in the sleep record.  
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG monitoring spanned 10/11-15/06.  A single seizure was recorded on the first day of admission.  No additional seizures were recorded and unfortunately the EEG recording from the 14th through to the date of discharge on the 15th is not available.  
	
	Abnormalities included a single seizure, which began as a complex partial seizure and was not well localized by scalp EEG.  There were interictal epileptiform discharges.  In the past for this patient there have been right temporal findings and generalized spike and wave activity, but in the last piece of EEG provided, there are left temporal sharp waves suggesting a more widespread epileptogenic foci than previously recognized.
