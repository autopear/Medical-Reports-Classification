CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 71-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, change in mental status, and incontinence found unresponsive.  
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Coumadin, Glucotrol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as intubated and unresponsive to external stimuli.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow but continuous with primarily a theta frequency background. There are occasional triphasic waves identified from the frontotemporal regions and occasional periodic sharp waves identified from either hemisphere.  There is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  Stimulation of the patient produces a subtle change in the background with a slight decrease in the amplitude and in the time around stimulation of the patient, there are no PLEDS or triphasic waves.  In some portions of the record, the activity is a bit more prominent in the left frontotemporal region.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Occasional triphasic waves.
Occasional periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  There are no strongly lateralizing features.  This EEG supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter.  Contributing factors can include a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy and/or postictal state as well as anoxia.  If this patient remains comatose and the metabolic issues have been addressed, a follow-up EEG may be valuable.
