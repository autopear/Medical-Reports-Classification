CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old woman with multiple medical problems, bilateral
CVAs and brief cardiac arrest.
MEDICATIONS:   Vance, Pantoprazole, Zosyn
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a very disorganized  and slightly discontinuous background.  The background is of mixed frequencies and mostly of a theta pattern reaching 5-6 Hz.   Sharp waves are seen independently in the right and
left occipital regions.  Occasional eye flutter is seen in the record, minimally more on the left frontal regions than the right.
	HR: 	70   bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Slow disorganized  mixed frequency background  which is slightly discontinuous.
	2. 	Independent occipital sharp waves.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no seizures seen on this record.  Regular occipital sharp waves are seen independently  coming from both posterior regions.  This could be a sign of bilateral foci for seizure activity. 	Correlated with imaging on this patient.
