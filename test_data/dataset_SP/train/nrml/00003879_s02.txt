CLINICAL HISTORY: Altered mental status, left PCA infarct, left cerebellar drain. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Lovenox, Pantoprazole, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, ASA 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is 
a significant intra-hemispheric asymmetry. On the left, it is lower voltage, more 
attenuated. On the right while there is some theta frequency activity, there is also 
sharply contoured periodic delta seen in intermittent bursts and even in double-phase 
reversal electronegative in the right occipital region. Stimulation of the patient produces 
an arousal with an increase in theta demonstrable bilaterally. The patient has an 
occasional left arm tremor which is not associated with a change in the EEG. As the 
recording continues, there are different areas of focal delta including right posterior 
quadrant but also some in the right anterior quadrant. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Relative attenuation of faster frequency activity from the left occipital temporal 
region. 
2. Sharply contoured delta activity or sharp waves in the right occipital region with 
same unusual dipole. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record is actually somewhat slower than the study on 
March 9. In addition, the sharp waves on the right are more prominent. No seizures 
were observed.
