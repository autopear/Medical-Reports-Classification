CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 72-year-old male with a history of left CA encephalomalacia, recent status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan(?), Dilantin, Phenobarbital.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is comatose and there are no involuntary movements seen in this portion of the record.  The portion of the record seen is on 4/18/03 and starts at 14:12:40 and ends at 16:30:07
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, there is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact in the background although there are no clinical seizures recorded.  As the recording continues, additional floaters are used and there is a periodic sharp wave identified from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions, but with generous spread to the frontal regions as well.  The remainder of the background is low voltage beta with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity from the left hemisphere including the left temporal region. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for this section of the record due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
Generalized background slowing and overall suppression.
Focal delta from the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG is compatible with a postictal pattern, as well as a structural or functional abnormality on the left.
