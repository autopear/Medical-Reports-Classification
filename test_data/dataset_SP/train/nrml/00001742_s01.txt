CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old female with tonic-clonic seizure at home and awoke with a 
tongue laceration. The patient has been experiencing intermittent paroxysmal nauseas. 
MEDICATIONS: None 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EEG. Photic stimulation performed. Hyperventilation not 
performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Awake and asleep study. Well-defined organized 
posterior dominant rhythm is seen at 9-10 H2 at 25 microvolts. As this record continues, regular 
right anterior temporal spike and slow waves are seen. At times there are more sharp waves 
with a following slow wave. There is a generous f1eld of spread that occurs with this epileptiform 
activity. This epileptiform activity seems to come more as the patient transitions into sleep. 
Drowsiness is seen with slowing of the background rhythm. Stage II sleep is seen with vertex 
waves, K complexes, and some spindles.. The overall background rhythm stays within normal 
limits. HV activates the high amplitude sharp waves. During photic stimulation, the patient begins 
to get drowsy, and there are again some sharp and slow waves seen but not activated by the 
photic stimulation. Minimal driving is also seen. 
HR: 72bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Spike and sharp waves seen in the right anterior temporal region with a generous field 
of spread, more extensive during early stages of sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION There are no seizures in this record. The epileptiform activity is 
consistent with a focal mechanic of seizures. After this, the patient was hooked up for long-term 
monitoring for further evaluation for seizures.
