CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old woman with intracerebral hemorrhage and left brain
resection without bone flap with residual weakness and aphasia. Transferred to T4 secondary to decreased responsiveness and hypoxia.
MEDICATIONS:   Atrovent, Cozaar, Keppra, Synthroid, Zetia, Digoxin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed  at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Left skull defect noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the start of the record an interhemispheric asymmetry is seen with slower, more attenuated rhythm seen in the left hemisphere.  At times excess beta activity is seen as well as in the left hemisphere. Posterior dominant rhythm on the right is seen at 7 Hz. It is not well elicited in the left hemisphere. Once in the record a T3 sharp wave is seen. There is arrhythmic delta activity in the record.
HR:   66 bpm and irregular.
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	More attenuation in the left hemisphere with slower and more attenuation seen in the left hemisphere.
	2. 	Generally slowness of the background.
	3.	One P3 sharp wave seen.
	4. 	Arrhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no seizures recorded in this record. The one P3 sharp wave could be a localization for epilepsy. The slowing of the background is nonspecific and can be due to an encephalopathy due to toxic metabolic or medication causes. The intrahemispheric asymmetry with lower amplitude in the left hemisphere and the increase in beta activity on this hemisphere could be consistent with the patient's history of a breech rhythm on that
hemisphere.
