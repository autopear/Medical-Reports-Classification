CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old male with epilepsy since his teenage years; two MVAs with breakthrough seizures at age 40.  Seizures occur “24 times a month.” 
MEDICATIONS: PHT
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The overall background is relatively sharply contoured, and there are a number of unusual morphologies identified in this record.  There are intermittent bursts of generalized, spike and slow wave activity, which are of high amplitude, with variable fields including one maximum on the right.  They are picked up in the eye leads and they are so high amplitude that they almost appear artifactual, but the spikes can be found in the occipital regions suggesting that they can’t be an artifact. There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta with occasional shifting asymmetries.  There are a handful of subtle, left temporal sharp waves. 
Photic stimulation elicits a small degree of driving.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background, as well as accentuating the hypersynchronous bursts of high amplitude frontal spike and slow wave complexes.  
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant generalized spike and slow wave activity with an unusual field of spread, but with a biological appearance. 
Generalized background slowing.
Rare left frontotemporal sharp waves.
Occasional frontal delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  Given the focal and generalized epileptiform features described in this record, correlation with imaging may be of use.
