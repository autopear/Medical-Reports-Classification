CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old man with history of left-sided gunshot wound to the head 13 years ago and CVA February 14, 2009 with right-sided hemiplegia. 
MEDICATIONS: Simvastatin, Carvedilol, Gabapentin, Ranitidine, Fexofenadine HCL, Bisacodyl, Phenytek, Phenobarbital, ASA 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation performed. Awake and drowsy study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is an intra-hemispheric asymmetry seen with slower rhythm seen in the left hemisphere. Overall both backgrounds are slow, mostly in the theta range with some delta activity. There is an alpha rhythm seen reaching 7 Hz. Out of the left hemisphere bursts of sharply contoured slow waves originally seen. Mostly delta activity and can also be seen at times out of the right hemisphere but of greater amount of the left. Eye movements at times are not seen as symmetric and can be seen greater on the right frontal hemisphere. Sharp waves are seen in multiple regions, including T1, T5, P3 and F3. As the patient becomes drowsy, more of the sharp waves are seen in the left frontal central region instead of the temporal region. During photic stimulation there is no driving. FIRDA is seen. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized slowing of the background with asymmetry with greater slowing on the left hemisphere. 
2. Bursts of slowly contoured delta, greater on the left. 
3. Sharp waves seen at T1, F3, T5, P3. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are epileptiform discharges seen at multiple areas on the left hemisphere with a greater propensity for frontal central sharp waves when the patient becomes drowsy versus the temporal sharp waves. All these are possible focus for epilepsy. The asymmetry with the slowing of the left hemisphere could be significant for the patient's history of a gunshot wound and a breach pattern. No seizures were recorded during the study.
