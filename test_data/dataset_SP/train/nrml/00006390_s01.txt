CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 16, last seizure three days ago, episodes characterized by shaking for three to five minutes without incontinence or loss of consciousness, short-term memory loss.  
MEDICATIONS: Topamax and Carbamazepine.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In portions of the record, the background EEG is reasonably well organized with an 8 to 8.5 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm. Other portions of the record, particularly early drowsiness, demonstrate irregular delta seen independently or bilaterally from the temporal regions. On a brief occasion, this appears to be a little bit more rhythmic at T1.  There is a single T1 sharp and slow wave complex.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, accentuating the temporal slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. 
HR:  __ BPM. Check tech sheet
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
A mild degree of generalized background slowing and disorganization.
Irregular temporal slowing identified from both temporal regions, left greater than right.
A handful of left temporal sharp waves in this sharply contoured background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy, as well as a process that involves the temporal regions of both hemispheres.  No seizures were recorded.  No other EEGs were available for comparison.
