CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old woman with previous left, focal cortical stroke with 
TTP, dementia, past history of epilepsy and ongoing obtundation. 
MEDICATIONS: Unknown 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is uncomfortable with 
frequent complaint of pain with tactile stimulation. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is markedly 
abnormal. The activity includes nearly continuous, triphasic waves with an unusual field 
of spread. In addition, there are also focal sharp waves picked up in the record 
including C3, C4 and T5/01. Multiple montages are employed to confirm that there is, 
in fact, a triphasic wave, but there are also multifocal sharps observed in the record. 
Stimulation of the patient consistently produces an alerting response, typically lasting 
Â·less than 10 seconds. By the close of the record, the patient is stimulated and is more 
consistently interactive. The triphasic waves consistently attenuate with tactile 
stimulation, although some of the occipital sharp waves persist. The overall 
background, absent the triphasic waves and the sharp waves. is a theta pattern. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
2. Nearly continuous triphasic waves. 
3. Multifocal sharp waves 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports an underlying metabolic process with 
a clearly reactive triphasic waves. The underlying metabolic process may accentuate underlying sharp waves. No seizures were recorded.
