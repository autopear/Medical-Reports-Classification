CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old gentleman with recurrent seizures. This time left body twitching or facial twitching. No seizures were experienced by the patient on the day of the study. 
MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Keppra, Lorazepam, Metoprolol, Protonix, ASA, Heparin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record with photic stimulation. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The activity on the left demonstrates just mild background slowing with somewhat slow alpha rhythm. The major abnormality in this record is a nearly continuous semi-periodic complex in the right posterior quadrant with variable maximum. Today it is most commonly maximum at P4, but has some variability including 02 or T6. There is a bifid or poly spike component to it on occasion and on some occasions it starts at almost P4-C4 and then spreads to 02. The periodic complex persists through stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles. As the patient becomes drowsy the discharge is higher amplitude, again starting as a small discrete P4 complex and then spreading to a higher amplitude right occipital complex. Simulation of the patient produces an arousal and may briefly the attenuate the epileptiform activity. Photic stimulation elicits an arousal and again seems to blunt the epileptiform discharge, but the periodicity is not substantially impacted. 
HR: 66 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. An ongoing periodic discharge which is complex in nature in the right posterior quadrant, most prominent in the right parietal region, but with great involvement of the occipital and posterior temporal regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In an individual who has ongoing clinical symptoms of left hemibody peculiar sensations, this EEG represents a form of epilepsia partialis continua.
