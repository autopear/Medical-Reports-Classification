	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	71-year-old, right handed woman with a loss of consciousness and confusion in February and March of 2007. No episodes since that time.
MEDICATIONS: Pamelor, Nifedical, Atenolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the laboratory using the standard
10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively high amplitude for an adult of this age, with a 9 Hz, 50-70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral theta activity. There is occasional irregular theta or delta in the temporal region observed independently from the right or left. Central mu activity is observed, but testing is not performed to confirm this. Photic stimulation elicits no driving response.
	HR: 	66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
1. Greater than accepted for age right or left temporal irregular delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in underlying ischemic white matter disease or other pathology. No seizures and no epileptiform features were observed.
