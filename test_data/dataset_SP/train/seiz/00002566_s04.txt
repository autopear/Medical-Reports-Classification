CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old female with Hypoglycemic and anoxic 
encephalopathy, with persistent obtundation and episodes of eye blinking. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is a brief interruption in the 
recording when the patient moves rooms. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very slow 
pattern. In this slow pattern, there are occasional generalized sharp complexes, a little 
bit more prominent in the right hemisphere. There is also a seizure which concurs after 
1 of these complexes at 13:19. Seizure onset 13:17:52 which begins with subtle, 
rhythmic activity in the right temporal region after the periodic complex and then clearly 
evolves with definitive ictal pattern at 13:18:35. The patient is lying in bed during the 
seizure. There is little in the way of an electrocardiographic correlate and the EKG lead 
is not recording during the event. The seizure ends by 13:19. No definitive clinical 
correlates are associated with it. Heart rate is 120 BPM. Because of the lack of audio 
and the lack of documentation, it is not entirely clear if the seizure was recognized by 
others or not but it was reported to the clinical team during the event. Phenobarbital was 
given for this event. 
The second seizure identified is at 20:56, is relatively brief, begins with the same right 
temporal sharp waves in a train followed by a rhythmic theta. Faster frequency activity 
emerges in but they are clearly defined repetitive activity. The event is less than 30 
seconds in duration. 
9 a.m. episode of tachycardiac. The patient is intubated at the bedside. The EEG is 
slower than it had been. Of note, in the initial recording on May 26 going into May 27, 
prior to the patient's bath and moving about, the EEG pattern was beginning to show an 
increase in theta. With the episode of tachycardia to 200, both hemispheres are 
significantly slower but much more so on the right. This pattern improves a bit by 9:34 
as the heart rate slows to the 120 range. By later in the day on May 27, there seems to 
be a waxing and waning pattern with at times a bit more faster frequency activity on the 
left. The right remains relatively suppressed. Occasional 2 or muscle artifact is 
observed. By the close of this epoch, there seems to be a clear improvement in terms of 
the activity observed. The right is not quite as slow. There is muscle artifact, occasional 
triphasic waves. 
HR: 100-200 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. 
A number of brief complex partial seizures recorded without clear clinical 
correlates. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The seizures were identified by the clinical team, 
suggesting that there were clinical correlates not otherwise described. Additional 
neurodiagnostic testing may be helpful to determine the active processes in the right 
hemisphere.
