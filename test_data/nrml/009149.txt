CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 24-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy, CSE, LGS  
MEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Dilantin, Klonopin, Flonase, Zyrtec, and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an extremely cognitively impaired individual with vocalizations and overall impaired cooperativity. The patient also has spontaneous involuntary movements and no language. Previous EEGs are not available for comparison. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes nearly continuous epileptiform activity, which is variable.  There are slow spike and wave complexes, as well as high amplitude, almost periodic sharp waves identified throughout the background, typically at least one per second.  The fields and the amplitudes of the epileptiform activity are variable including the frontal regions, central regions, and posterior regions.  On some occasions, there is a phase reversal at T2 and on some occasions there is more slowing on the right than the left.  There are frontally predominant poly spike and slow wave complexes noted as well.  Many of the discharges are synchronous, maximum in the frontal regions; others are synchronous and seem to be maximum more in the posterior regions.  There is some variability in the record when the patient has movement of the right arm. There is an increase in theta in the background and a very slight decrease in epileptiform activity.  There is no clear frequency evolution for the frequent epileptiform discharges.  Phase reversal for these discharges includes the parietal regions bilaterally, the posterior temporal regions as well as the frontal regions.   
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Nearly continuous sharp waves, periodic complexes or spike and slow wave complexes involving multiple regions of each hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports an underlying epileptic encephalopathy.  No typical seizures with clear frequency evolution were identified and the patient's mental status was at baseline.  Comparison with previous EEGs may be useful.  Of note, this patientâ€™s epilepsy was considered well controlled during the study.
