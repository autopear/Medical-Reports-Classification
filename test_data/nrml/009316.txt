CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old gentleman status post a fall down 13 steps on September 22, 2010 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and right parietal skull defect. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Dilaudid, Darbepoetin, Metoprolol, Famotidine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake or drowsy and is sometimes moaning in discomfort. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is lower voltage with some extra 5-7 Hz activity. There is intermittent background delta. There is a skull defect with some head rocking artifact observed at T4. The record is intermittently somewhat discontinuous with attenuation, but when the patient is moaning, the activity is much more vigorous and with more rhythmic theta. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Low voltage background. 
2. Generalized slowing. 
3. Occasional background attenuation. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with traumatic brain injury, when the patient is more interactive, the background EEG demonstrates a more continuous and vigorous pattern. This is more supportive of a severe disturbance of cerebral function, but positive prognostic features include the variability and a simply slow state in maximal wakefulness.
