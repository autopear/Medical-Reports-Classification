CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 20-year-old male with encephalitis transferred from Jeannes with two abnormalities on imaging and an abulic or encephalopathic syndrome.  Patient had headache for one week and stiff neck.  Patient received a Phenytoin load immediately prior to this long-term monitor.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Decadron, Dilantin.  
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent and subtly postures the right hand.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage and slow.  There is variability in the record with later portions of the record demonstrating more artifact, but also more faster frequency activity and an increase in the background.  In addition, in later portions of the record, the patient is more consistently awake with eye opening and eye closure.  In the overnight recording, he drifts off to sleep.  At 4:00 AM, a spontaneous arousal is seen.   As the overnight recording continues, there is variability in the pattern with some portions of the record demonstrating more higher amplitude delta, although it is a very low voltage pattern.  There are intermittent portions of the record with the patient demonstrating eye opening and a bit more theta.  
The push button log does not identify any push buttons.  The computerized seizure and spike detector does not identify any seizures.  
This EEG ends on 6/22/06 at 14:27.  The EEG continues to demonstrate a variable pattern with some portions of the record demonstrating more delta than others.  The small sharp waves identified in the initial portions of the record are not so prominent.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response with eye opening and eye closure, but the overall pattern is quite low voltage.  
HR:  60 to 80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG monitoring for this 24-hour video EEG was remarkable for:
	1.	Markedly slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing identifies more reactivity and variability as the recording continued in comparison to the baseline.  Of note, the small discrete frontocentral sharp waves seen in the initial portions of the record were not identified subsequently.
