CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old woman with a left subcortical stroke who presents with right-sided shaking and weakness. 
MEDICATIONS: Midazalam and Dilantin.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous and reasonably well organized.  It is rich in theta frequency activity, as well as superimposed beta frequency activity.  There is occasional focal slowing seen from the right with sharply contoured theta or delta identified.  As the recording continues, as the patient becomes agitated, there is more muscle in the background.  The patient reaches sleep with occasional vertex waves.   Overall, the focal slowing from the right is mainly intermittent.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing. 
Excess background beta.
Intermittent focal slowing from the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen and no seizures were recorded.  This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  This patientâ€™s medications may be contributing to this pattern.  Given the history of stroke, the focal features are relatively modest.
