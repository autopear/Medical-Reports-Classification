CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 63-year-old gentleman with intractable complex partial seizures, s/p CVA.   
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, others
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG shows an alpha frequency of 7 to 8 Hz, 40 to 60 V.  Occasional left delta is seen in the temporal region in hyperventilation, as well as some arrhythmic delta activity. In sleep, POSTS, K complexes, vertex waves and spindles are seen.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR:  55 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Occasional left delta in the temporal region with hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The left delta seen in the temporal region is consistent with the patientâ€™s history of previous left MCA infarction leading to seizures.  Also the patient has a history of vasotemporal sclerosis.
