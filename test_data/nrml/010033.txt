	CLINICAL HISTORY:   40 year old male who suffered a left A aneurysm rupture after a cocaine ingestion, 6 days status post right frontal evacuation, day 5 left craniotomy, and clipping of the ACA aneurysm (Subarachnoid hemorrhage).	
MEDICATIONS:  Vecuronium, Propofol, Morphine, Dilantin, Nimodipine, Mannitol, Tylenol, Zofran
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous  digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an acute postÂ­ surgical patient.  There are no clinical notes to indicate that the patient has had a change relevant to his EEG on December 2.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record demonstrate  a suppressed pattern on the left.  The right hemisphere  demonstrates intermittent background  suppression
with occasional sharp waves on the right. There are no notations in the record regarding the use of sedative/hypnotic  medications.
By 8:40a.m., the activity is considerably more suppressed on the right.  There is also electrode artifact.  By 11 a.m., there is some cerebral activity observed bilaterally in the frontocentral regions on occasion. The overall pattern is quite suppressed.
	HR: 	66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A very suppressed pattern on the left.
2.  Discontinuous  pattern on the right.
3.  Intermittent, bilateral cerebral activity is present.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is very limited clinical information provided and, hence, little in the way of clinical correlates can be made.
