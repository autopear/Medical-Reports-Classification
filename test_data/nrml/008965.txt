CLINICAL HISTORY:  51-year-old gentleman status post head injury in 1988, last seizure a month ago, characterized  by shaking lasting a few minutes. He has a skull defect ?n the right frontal and temporal region.
MEDICATIONS:   Lexapro, Dilantin, Phenobarbital,  Cogentin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed in the end.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates and intrahemispheric  asymmetry. The left hemisphere demonstrates mild slowing with an alpha rhythm of 8 Hz. The right hemisphere is higher amplitude, demonstrates  slowing of the alpha rhythm and underlying arrhythmic delta activity throughout the right hemisphere, particularly centra, temporal and parietal. Breach rhythm is characterized
by an increase in amplitude on that side. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Brief drowsiness is characterized  by slow rolling eye movements.
	HR: 	84 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Mild slowing on the left.
	2. 	Superimposed focal slowing on the right with arrhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen. Breath rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
