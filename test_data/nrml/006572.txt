CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed female with left skull defect, hepatitis C, epilepsy, possible meningitis, HIV disease, syphilis, and gonorrhea. To evaluate for seizures. Currently expiring visual scotomas. 
MEDICATIONS: Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone, Dilantin, Acyclovir, Vancomycin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. 
Some portions are more of a pattern of rhythmic mid frequency theta activity. Other sections are more rhythmic, 2 to 4 hertz activity. FIRDA is observed. Brief sleep is characterized by spindles. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. The Photic fraction is remarkable for significant very slow frequency artifact as might be seen in the context of sweat. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Significant background slowing. 
2. Subtle beta asymmetry with at times beta spindles a bit more prominent on the right compared to the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. This EEG is most reportable with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.
