CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 74-year-old male with a history of a right MCA stroke in October 2004 with involvement of the right frontal lobe and basal ganglia.   
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and blood pressure medications. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is moderately slow with an intrahemispheric asymmetry showing a posterior dominant rhythm on the left hemisphere of 6.5 Hz, and more pronounced focal slowing on the right hemisphere.  The right hemisphere has an increased percentage of delta frequency.  Stage II sleep is achieved and characterized by bilateral spindles and vertex waves.  The intrahemispheric asymmetry is not as prominent in sleep as during wakefulness.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intrahemispheric asymmetry due to generalized background slowing.
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with more pronounced slowing over the right hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform discharges were seen.  The EEG findings are consistent with a structural abnormality on the right involving gray matter.  Correlation with previous EEGs, if available, would be of value.  Correlation with neuroimaging studies is appropriate.
