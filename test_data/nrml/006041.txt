CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old male with syncopal episode in September of 2008, 
with past history of epilepsy, but seizure-free for the last 4 years, hypertension, 
schizophrenia and anxiety. 
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Procardia, Dilantin, Zestril, HCTZ, Tegretol, Geodon, 
Ativan, Cogeritin, Sequel 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation 11re completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 
reasonably well-organized pattern, but with a slow alpha rhythm of 6.5 to 7.5 Hz. 
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and does produce an increase in 
slowing. Some head rocking artifact is picked up at the C4 electrode. Features of sleep included an increase in beta, as well as vertex waves. Photic stimulation does not 
activate the record. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slowing of the alpha rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION No epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an 
important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing an event may be appropriate. The 
background slowing described above is nonspecific and may be due to this patient's 
underlying neurologic disease or medications.
