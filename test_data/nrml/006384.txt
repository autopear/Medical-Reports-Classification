CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male with longstanding refractory epilepsy, now with crescendo seizures, seizure-related fall, and complaint of left-sided numbness.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, and Zonisamide. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and elicits a symmetric, frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and wave activity.  Following hyperventilation, the patient is drowsy.  Additional frontal, spike and slow wave activity is noted. The patient had an event following hyperventilation in the lab.  The patient appeared fearful.  The patient had difficulty stopping hyperventilation, but during the time when he was slow to answer the technologist, there were no prolonged epileptiform discharges.   The majority of the frontal spike and slow wave activity is symmetric, but occasionally it may be seen more prominently in the right or left frontal regions.   Photic stimulation is performed.  There is some occasional spike and wave activity noted in photic stimulation, but not increased compared to the remainder of the record.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with rare vertex waves. 
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Frontally predominant generalized spike and wave activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern of epileptiform activity has been previously identified for this individual.  No seizures were recorded.
