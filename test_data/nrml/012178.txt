CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed woman with 3 day headache and superior sagittal thrombosis on February 19th. Frontal lobe pathology. 

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tylenol, Cipro 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed .at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm reaching only 8 hertz. There is occasional shifting slowing which may begin in the left frontal region, but be more prolonged in the right. The patient transitions in and out from wakefulness to stage II sleep with hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Stage If sleep is much more symmetric with vertex wave complexes, spindles and posts. 

HR: 66 bpm 

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing. 
2. Mild dysorganization for an adult of this age. 
3. Bursts of shifting, paroxysmal rhythmic frontal slowing. 

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes. The paroxysmal frontal slowing may be correlated with this patient's frontal lobe pathology.
