By report had a seizure around 1 p.m., however, this seizure cannot be identified.Unfortunately, overall electrode quality is extremely poor. This is a 3 hour studyDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite poor electrode quality, occasional left temporal sharp waves are observed in wakefu lness. The patient sits up and out of bed frequently. He rubs on his head successively devastating electrode integrity in the central and temporal regions particularly on the left.HR:	78 bpmIMPRESS ON: Abnormal EEG due to:1. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.CLINICAL CORRELATION: The report of a seizure was not found either screening the video or the EEG, but EEG terminates at 130 hence the event in question may have been overlooked.
