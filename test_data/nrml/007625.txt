CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year-old female with an episode of becoming combative and 
drowsy at home. Became disoriented. The patient was admitted for these symptoms. 
No seizures reported. 
MEDICATIONS: Cozaar, Aspirin, Atenolol, Levothyroxine, Zocor, Nexium, Heprain, 
Insulin, Advair, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible 
but photic stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, background EEG is 
medium amplitude and includes a mixture of theta and alpha frequency activity. There 
appears to be a slow posterior dominant rhythm at 7 -8 Hz frequency. There is also 
some subtle focal slowing from the right. There is a low voltage sharp wave observed in 
the background from the right temporal region. This is a relatively subtle finding and 
does occur in the context of wicket. Photic stimulation elicits brief, bilateral driving. 
HR: 70 bpm, slightly irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Intermittent, superimposed focal slowing on the right. 
3. Subtle underlying focal sharp waves in the right hemisphere, maximum in the right 
temporal region.
