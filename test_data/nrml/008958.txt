CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old gentleman with a previous right MCA infarct, history of refractory epilepsy, purposeful movements on the right. 
MEDICATIONS: Lamotrigine, Dilantin, Baclofen, ASA, Vancomycin, Lamictal, Dobutamine, Norepinephrine, Phenylephrine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is receiving respiratory support and appears to be quite unwell. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background includes a theta frequency pattern. There is an asymmetry with at times a somewhat suppressed pattern from the right hemisphere compared to the left. Overall the temporal regions of both hemispheres demonstrated a bit more vigorous cerebral activity. There are occasional frontally predominant triphasic waves and rare sharp waves noted from either hemisphere. The overall background is richer in faster frequency activity. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity. The right arm movements do not carry an EEG signature. 
HR: 120-130 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Triphasic waves. 
2. Rare sharp waves in both hemispheres. 
3. Focal slowing 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional evaluation as to the cause of the bihemispheric sharp waves may be appropriate. No seizures were recorded.
