CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 42-year-old woman with mental retardation and childhood epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures and postictal confusion, left parietal and right occipital white matter changes, as well as hippocampal atrophy.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, and Lamictal. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is asleep.  The background is poorly organized with primarily a theta frequency pattern and some posterior slowing.  There are frequent high amplitude spike and slow wave discharges in the left mid-to-anterior temporal region, as well as lower, independent right temporal sharp waves.  The patient had some fluctuation.  As she becomes sleepier, there is an increase in hypersynchronous background slowing.  With brief stimulation, there is eye opening and brief alerting, but wakefulness is not sustained.  After this, she drifts off to stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal, primarily asleep EEG due to:
Left anterior spike and slow wave activity.
Occasional right intertemporal sharp and slow wave discharges. 
Poor organization with posteriorly predominant delta.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  These findings may be correlated with this patientâ€™s imaging.  No seizures were recorded.
