CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 83-year-old woman with seizures associated with a stroke, now UTI with waxing and waning language capacity.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This section captures wakefulness and sleep.  No clinical seizures are noted by the team and no seizures are picked up by the system. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to show rhythmic slowing from the left hemisphere, particularly the frontocentral region with rare slowing seen from the right.  The patient has fragmented sleep and there are frequent arousals throughout the night. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal 24-hour video EEG due to:
	1.	Left frontocentral or left hemisphere slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This long-term monitoring represents improvement from previous studies.
