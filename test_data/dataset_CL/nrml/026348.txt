CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 68-year-old male with stroke, hypertension, seizures, and brain stem hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, Dilantin, and Cardizem.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab? using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is agitated throughout much of the record.  When he is cooperative, the record includes a mixture of theta frequency activity, low voltage, frontocentral beta activity, and a suggestion of an alpha rhythm.  He has intermittent eye blink artifact, intermittent bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta.  Agitation is associated with more rhythmic, frontal 3 to 4 Hz activity.  
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Moderate, generalized background slowing.
Intermittent paroxysmal frontal theta and delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded, no PLEDS were seen, and no significant spike and slow wave complexes were identified.  The patient’s agitation in association with rhythmic frontal theta/delta would suggest a toxic or metabolic affect, although this patient’s intracerebral hemorrhage could produce the same pattern.
