CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 42-year-old woman with hypertension, sickle cell disease, renal failure, hepatitis C, DVT, pancreatitis, sickle cell crisis with abdominal pain with newly identified MRI abnormalities and first ever seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, ______________, Dilantin, morphine.  Check tech sheet please
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is uncomfortable and lethargic.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The overall pattern is one of rhythmic, 3 to 4 Hz activity with variable phase reversals.  The frontally predominant triphasic waves underlying this rhythmic background, depending on the montage used, there is a suggestion of an underlying right frontotemporal focus.  However, with re-montage and reformatting, this appears to be a bit more rhythmic, right frontal activity which is accentuated by underlying triphasic waves.  There is variability in the background and arousal produces more 6 to 8 Hz activity.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz slowing.
Triphasic waves.
Underlying right frontal, sharply contoured activity.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are multiple hallmarks of a metabolic encephalopathy identified in this record. There are also some subtle focal features.  The EEG described above is likely a manifestation of the multiple medical and neurologic problems for this patient.  No seizures were recorded.
