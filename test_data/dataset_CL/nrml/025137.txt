epilepsy.
HISTORY:  This is a 37-year-old woman with refractory temporal lobe
MEDICATIONS:  Ly1ica and  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD:   As the tracing opens, the  background EEG includes nearly continuous, rhythmic slowing from the left temporal region with high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes. The background from the right is somewhat slow.   There are rare right temporal sharp waves.  Hyperventilation is perfom1ed with good effort and may accentuate the background.   Drowsiness is  characterized by an increase in background slowing.  Vertex waves and spindles are identified in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Continuous left temporal sharp waves, spikes, and focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG is supportive of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy and a highly irritative process.
