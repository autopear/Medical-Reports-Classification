CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old with recurrent meningioma and tonic-clonic seizure. Temporal lobe edema. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Keppra, Trazodone, Lasix 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is noted to have a previous craniotomy site. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slightly slow and disorganized pattern from the right. There is a prominent intra hemispheric asymmetry with marked disruption of faster frequency activity on the left, arrhythmic delta on the left, breach rhythm and epileptiform activity which primarily consists of a C3 sharp wave or spike. Sometimes the sharp waves are associated with fast activity and often associated with an after going slow wave. They have a generous field of spread in the central region including to the midline. The focal slowing includes the mid to posterior temporal region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. There is a 7 Hz to 8 Hz alpha rhythm defined in wakefulness. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR: 54 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly the central and posterior temporal regions. 
2. Left central sharp waves often occurring in bursts. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left congruent with this patient's wide spread MRI abnormalities. Although there was prominent epileptiform activity, no seizures were recorded.
