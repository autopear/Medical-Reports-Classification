INTRODUCTION: 
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system, as well as anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. The patient was lethargic during the study. No activation procedures were performed. Just stimulation to the patient was performed. 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:
None. 
MEDICATIONS: 
None listed. 
HISTORY: 
A 48 year-old man with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease, HIV and asthma who presented with complaints of frontal headache, blurry vision and hypertensive urgency, now not responding to stimuli and not waking up.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to a diffusely slow attenuated recording with no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontal central activity. No normal sleep architecture is seen. No activation procedures were performed. During the recording, the tech causes painful stimulation to the lower extremities, which caused a change in the reactivity of the EEG to increase faster frequencies, as well as muscle reactivity is present.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Diffuse slow waves at 2Hz and 20 to 30 microvolts amplitude. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to diffuse slow waves, moderate to severe. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG reveals moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
