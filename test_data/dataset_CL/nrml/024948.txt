CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 40-year-old male with epilepsy, with three seizures in one day.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol and Topiramate. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The video does not include the patient. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal with a pattern that includes mixed theta and smaller amounts of alpha frequency activity.  There is a small amount of delta.  There is fluctuation and variability with some portions of the record demonstrating more frontal delta than others with more theta and a small amount of alpha frequency activity.  Intermixed in this unusual background, there are some triphasic waves.  There are also some right frontocentral sharp waves and some occasional left frontotemporal sharp waves.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in frontal delta.  Photic stimulation may produce an increase in rhythmicity of the record and may also accentuate the epileptiform activity.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Abnormal background with generalized slowing. 
	Left frontotemporal spike and slow wave activity.
	Independent right centrotemporal sharp waves.
	FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging and clinical course.  No seizures were recorded.  Consideration for a more complex nature for this patientâ€™s epilepsy may be appropriate.
