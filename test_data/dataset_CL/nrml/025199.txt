	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	21-month-old toddler with, former 27-week preemie, with tracheostomy, history of placental insufficiency, chronic static encephalopathy, was admitted on the September 25 with new onset febrile seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenobarbital, Calcium
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in nursery using standard 1020 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The technologist describes the child as unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE R ECORD:  Background EEG is medium amplitude, relatively featureless. There is rhythmic theta activity in the frontal regions observed bilaterally. The remainder of the cerebral activity is low-voltage slow delta with more rhythmic higher amplitude to 3 Hz delta in the left central region. Stimulation  of the patient does not seem to activate the record. There are occasional brief trains of left temporal sharp waves.
	HR: 	130 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Paucity of the normal developmental milestones for a child of this age.
	2.		Frontal theta, at times typically symmetric, but at times a little bit more remarkable on the right.
	3. 		Brief trains of left temporal sharp waves, but without characteristic  ictal evolution for a seizure.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded in this study today.
