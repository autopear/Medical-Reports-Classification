CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old woman with pulmonary cardiac arrest yesterday.  History of renal failure, CHF, respiratory failure, and seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, ventilator dependent, and unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and disorganized.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not identified.  Instead, there is continuous, frontally predominant triphasic activity, as well as sharp and slow activity.  Frequent, sharp or spike activity is seen at T3 and P3.  Stimulation of the patient did not produce reactivity  in the background.  
 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow and disorganized background.
Continuous, frontally predominant triphasic waves.
Occasional left central spike and sharp activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is indicative of a severe cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter, as well as deeper nuclei at the midline structure.  Triphasic waves can be seen in patients with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, anoxic events, or medication effect.  The focal spike and sharp activity is suggestive of the irritability of the cortex in that region.  No seizures were recorded during this tracing.
