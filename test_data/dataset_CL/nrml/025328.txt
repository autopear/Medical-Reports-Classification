CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 73-year-old woman with multiple bilateral strokes including brain stem ischemia. There is a history of intermittent eye twitching.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Plavix, other blood pressure medications.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and lethargic.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and poorly organized. The overall background includes a mixture of theta and delta frequency activity, which is relatively rhythmic.  There are triphasic waves identified in the frontal regions.  There are also some occasional periodic sharp complexes, which appear in the posterior temporal regions bilaterally, but seem to be a bit more prominent on the right compared to the left.  There is variability in the record, and some portions of the record demonstrate significantly less in the way of this activity.  The patient is resting comfortably at that time.  On several occasions, the patient has ocular twitching.  On all of these occasions, these are the portions of the record where the EEG is well organized without the triphasic waves or periodic complexes.  
By the close the record, the patient is noted to have some ocular twitching.  On this occasion, the occipital sharp activity can be identified, but it is not periodic.  
HR:  90 BPM, irregular.
	
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Triphasic waves.
Posteriorly predominant sharp activity with unclear correlation with this patient’s ocular movements.   
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to the previous study, the background is richer and there is faster frequency activity.  The side-to-side asymmetries are less remarkable.  The PLEDS and the triphasics are new features and may be related to this patient’s structural brain abnormalities and/or underlying metabolic abnormalities. No seizures were recorded.
