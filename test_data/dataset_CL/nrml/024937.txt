CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old woman with COPD exacerbation, past history of epilepsy, and stroke history with myoclonic jerks, tremors, or possible seizures associated with steroid use. 
MEDICATIONS: More than fifteen including Ambien, Solumedrol, Levetiracetam, and antibiotics. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a background that is intermittently reasonably well organized with a definable posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz, 40 uV.  There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and/or triphasic waves.  There are also sharp waves identified in the record with variable maximum and a variable field of spread.  They may be in the left occipital or T5 left posteriotemporal.  They have a generous field of spread in the bi-occipital regions and some of them have a different field in the left posteriotemporal region, but involving the centroparietal areas as well.  The sharp waves can be seen in association with the bursts of FIRDA or triphasic waves, or independently.  Photic stimulation does seem to elicit a driving response at faster flash frequencies.  
Features of drowsiness include an increase in the FIRDA.   
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Intermittent bursts of FIRDA.
	Bursts of triphasic waves. 
	Epileptiform activity primary from the left hemisphere with an unusual spread. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The FIRDA and the triphasic waves suggest that there may well be an underlying metabolic encephalopathy.  This may accentuate the epileptiform activity described above.  No seizures were recorded, however, this is a very abnormal background.  Additional clinical evaluation may be important.
