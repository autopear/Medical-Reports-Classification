CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 95-year-old woman who presented with unresponsiveness.  Last seen two to three days prior to admission.  Sepsis, gastroenteritis CHF and hypertension.  
MEDICATIONS: ? check tech sheet
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low voltage and quite slow pattern with diffuse low voltage delta and some scant amounts of low voltage beta.  Stimulation of the patient produces a very small amount of theta as well as occasional bursts of delta.  There is little in the way of variability in the record.  
HR:  96 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with low voltage delta and scant amounts of beta. 
Minimal reactivity and variability. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  Correlation with imaging and other clinical correlates may be useful.  No epileptiform features were seen and no seizures were recorded.
