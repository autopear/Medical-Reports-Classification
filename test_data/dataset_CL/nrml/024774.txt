CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 56-year-old, right-handed male in recurrent status epilepticus. Post CVA epilepsy
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ER using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, but is moving about.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is generous, continuous beta with bursts of generalized delta, some of which is frontally predominant.  There is artifact picked up from the temporalis muscles bilaterally.  As the recording continues, the delta decreases and the EEG is more a pattern of continuous beta. 
HR:  98 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a pattern of continuous beta and decreasing amounts of delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified and no seizures were recorded.  To further characterize this patientâ€™s underlying epilepsy, a repeat study when the patient is no longer in status epilepticus may be valuable.
