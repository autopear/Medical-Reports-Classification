CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old woman with breast cancer with multiple metastases, migraine headaches and possible seizures.
 
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin.
 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly slow and disorganized. In addition, there is prominent shifting arrhythmic delta activity and some frontally predominant triphasic waves as well as some left anterior temporal sharp waves and a handful in the right. Arrhythmic delta is noted in the record, a bit more prominent in the left anterior temporal region, however, there is also an intrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of fast or frequency activity in the right frontocentral region. Finally, there are some bursts in the posterior region which are sharply contoured. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly abnormal background. 
2. Sharp waves in the left frontal region. 
3. Posterior sharp waves. 
4. Triphasic waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Correlation with imaging is recommended. In this highly irritative EEG, no seizures were observed.
