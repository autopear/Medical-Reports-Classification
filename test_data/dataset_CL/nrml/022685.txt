CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old woman with right PCOM aneurysm, grade 4 status post hemorrhage, right ventriculostomy, craniectomy on the left. 
MEDICATIONS: Gentamicin, Codeine, Morphine, Zosyn, Insulin, Pantoprazole, Keppra, Vancomycin, Nimodipine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The EEG electrodes are modified due to the patient's swelling and absence of cranium on the left hemisphere. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and demonstrates a dramatic intrahemispheric asymmetry. The right hemisphere includes rhythmic theta frequency activity with occasional delta. The left hemisphere demonstrates activity which is lower voltage, slow, relatively featureless. The deformity due to the absence of a cranium is observed, but despite this, there are also some left anterior temporal sharp waves maximum at 7 primarily. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in amplitude on the right but not on the left. Intermittent trembling is noted during the EEG. The trembling on the left hemibody is not associated with epileptiform activity. 
HR: 96 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked intrahemispheric asymmetry. 
2. Marked suppression of activity on the left. 
3. Occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves. 
4. Stimulation of the patient produces reactivity only on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The magnitude of these findings is congruent with the patient's clinical history and imaging. No seizures were observed.
