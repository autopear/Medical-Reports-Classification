CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year-old gentleman with end-stage renal disease, with a history of 
status epilepticus approximately 10 days ago, now with Gl bleed and urosepsis. Intermittent 
obtundation. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Topiramate 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is relatively somnolent but arousable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG includes a theta frequency pattern. 
There is rhythmic, notched frontal theta. In addition, there is a right frontotemporal highamplitude 
spike and slow wave complex discernible in the region of the patient's craniotomy. 
The overall background waxes and wanes with some portions richer in theta and others with a 
bit more arrhythmic delta activity. Stimulation of the patient is performed only on 1 occasion 
and occurs when the patient was relatively drowsy. Stimulation of the patient produces an 
accentuation of arrhythmic delta on the right. 
HR: 112 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to. 
1. Replacement of normal background with primarily a theta frequency background. 
2. Right frontotemporal high-amplitude spike and slow wave complexes 
3. Intermittent asymmetry with more arrhythmic delta on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded today. The patient background 
slowing is nonspecific and can be seen in the context of a severe disturbance in cerebral 
function as well as toxic metabolic encephalopathy. Comparison with previous studies is 
advised.
