CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 54-year-old male/female? with CVA and right hemiparesis, change in speech, and altered mentation.  
MEDICATIONS: 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is agitated throughout the EEG.  Despite this, a 6.5 to 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm can be identified bilaterally.  When the patient is quiet, an intrahemispheric asymmetry can be identified with lower voltage delta from the left and attenuation of faster frequency activity from the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing with attenuation of faster frequency from the left frontocentral/frontotemporal regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Consideration for a structural or functional abnormality involving the cortex in the left frontocentral/frontotemporal regions is appropriate.  No seizures or epileptiform features were seen.
