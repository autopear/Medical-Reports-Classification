		CLINICAL HISTORY: 	64-year-old female, who presents with episodes of right hand shaking and aphasia, then patient reported left upper extremity weakness. EEG to rule out CVA. PMH: Significant for seizures, status post 	subarachnoid hemorrhage, and craniotomy in October of
2006.
	MEDICATIONS: 	None.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness 10 Hz alpha rhythm, identified bilaterally. It is symmetric and reactive. Brief rhythm is identified in the left temporal region and includes accentuation of fast activity, and irregular mixed theta and delta. The theta and delta can be posterior temporal or anterior temporal. In addition there are occasional F723 sharp waves. Drowsiness accentuates the focal slowing and the sharp waves. Hyperventilation  produces increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits supraÂ­ harmonic driving.
HR: is 60 bpm
IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal EEG due to focal slowing at the left temporal region, which may be anterior or posterior temporal.
2. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
	CLINICA L CORRELATION: 	Focal slowing and epileptiform features are seen in the region of her previous neurosurgery. No seizures were recorded.
