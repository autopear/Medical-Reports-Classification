CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old woman with refractory epilepsy following childhood meningitis. 
MEDICATIONS: Levetiracetam 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness background the EEG is organized with 10.5 Hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Rhythmic temporal 3-5 Hertz activity is observed. Some of this is present on the left but there is a bit of arrhythmic delta activity observed on the right. The rhythmic 3-5 Hertz activity is most sustained in the left temporal region but again there are bursts of arrhythmic delta activity from the right with right anterior temporal sharpened slow wave complexes. Independent left temporal sharp waves submerge as the patient becomes drowsy. Towards the close of the study more sustained, right anterior temporal rhythmic 3 Hertz activity is observe with relatively frequent, awake, high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes. These are seen just as the patient starts to reach stage I sleep with vertex waves. Just as she does so, she is awakened for photic stimulation. Brief bilateral driving is seen and the epileptiform activity from the right temporal region is present. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Rhythmic 3-5 Herz activity in the temporal regions, primarily on the right with right greater than left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. No seizures were recorded. Prior EEGs shows similar findings.
