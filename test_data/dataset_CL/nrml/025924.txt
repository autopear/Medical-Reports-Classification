CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old woman with an aneurysm clipped many years ago followed by epilepsy and with a recent stroke, now unresponsive with possible seizures this morning.  
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Depakote, Topiramate, and Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is lethargic. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and is low voltage with a mixture of theta and delta.  The major abnormality in this tracing is a high amplitude right frontal spike and slow wave complex or sharp waves, which at times are periodic but on most occasions there are as many as six sharp waves in the right frontal region in a ten second period. There are also occasional, independent sharp waves identified from the left.  The left hemisphere seems to demonstrate a bit less in the way of theta frequency.  During this EEG, the patient is stimulated.  Stimulation clearly produces an increase in rhythmic theta in the background.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent, right frontal sharp waves. 
Severe generalized background slowing. 
Occasional sharp waves from the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a previous study, during this record, stimulation of the patient clearly produces an improvement in the overall background.  No seizures were recorded.
