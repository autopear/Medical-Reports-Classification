CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old male with multiple strokes, PEG, trach, now with persistent unresponsiveness following a nap.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Plavix, and Heparin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow, low voltage, with a mixture of 3 to 5 Hz activity with the majority of the activity being in the theta frequency range.  There is some superimposed focal slowing with somewhat higher amplitude delta activity from the left, particularly centrotemporal and frontotemporal in comparison to the right.  Stimulation of the patient does not alter the tracing, although there is variability with some portions of the record showing brief attenuation and other portions showing more of the arrhythmic delta activity or the focal features from the left. Sleep was characterized by the appearance of vertex waves.  Following this, tachypnea was noted.  During the tachypneic portions of the records, the patient seemed to arouse, but no epileptiform features were seen at that time.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal awake background with a pattern of primarily theta frequency activity in a subject of this age
Absence of reactivity.
Superimposed focal slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a relatively severe disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter, perhaps involving the left hemisphere more than the right.  No seizures and no epileptiform features were seen.  Sleep cycles were seen with the presence of vertex waves suggesting a chronic disturbance.
