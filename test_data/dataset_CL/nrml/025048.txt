CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 6-year-old boy with multiple episodes of eyes rolling back and generalized body shaking for 60 minutes.  FT. History of speech delay.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, Phenobarbital, antibiotics. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This recording is performed for a child with a chronic static encephalopathy who is responsive in an attempt to make sure that no subclinical seizures occur as medications are tapered.  This is a 6.5 hour EEG. There is no seizure log. In the EEG itself, there are no push button events, and the computer does not identify electrographic seizures.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG is remarkable for a moderate degree of artifact.  While the child has been described as responsive, he seems to be sleeping throughout much of the EEG with occipitally predominant delta.  The overall background is rich in delta and beta.  The awake recording for this child is remarkable for an extraordinary amount of background beta particularly in the frontal regions.  As the recording continues, the child is increasingly active.  At times, there is what is likely artifact identified as a single-channel phenomena in the T1-T2 channel, which is alpha frequency in nature.  What may well be the sleep record is characterized by posterior delta and frontal beta.  Compatible with the reduction of anesthetic medications, as the recording continues, the child is more active.  There are portions of the record with focal beta activity, which is asymmetric, seen much more prominent in the right frontal regions than the left, although the beta is extraordinary in both hemispheres.  
HR:  116 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Replacement of normal background for a child of this age with a pattern of prominent occipital delta and generous frontal fast activity. 
	An intermittent asymmetry with more remarkable fast activity from the right frontal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were identified in this record.  In contrast to a previous section of the record, the frontal sharp waves were not identified and this child did not appear to have jerking of the shoulders as previously noted.
