CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 62-year-old male with a history of head trauma and V-tach arrest, still intubated in a hard collar in the ICU.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as stuporous. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG remains abnormal. There is a high amplitude spike and slow wave complex identified from the left hemisphere, which is maximum at C3 but has a variable field of spread and sometimes is more prominent in the left frontotemporal region.  This high amplitude discharge demonstrates some volume convection to the right hemisphere.  It is superimposed on a low voltage pattern with mixed beta and theta frequency activity, as well as arrhythmic delta from the left.  Stimulation of the patient seems to increase the epileptiform activity and the activity is seen more frequently than once per second in the minute that follows, although there is no seizure.  On some occasions, following high amplitude spike and slow wave activity, the background is suppressed for up to two seconds. 
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
High amplitude, frequent spike and slow wave activity from the left hemisphere maximum in the central regions, but sometimes in the frontotemporal regions.  This activity is periodic in nature but does not evolve.
Generalized background slowing.
Arrhythmic delta from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this standard EEG, no seizures were recorded. Given the frequency of the epileptiform activity, however, an additional recording might be useful.  In comparison to previous studies, this is the first EEG without definite seizures.
