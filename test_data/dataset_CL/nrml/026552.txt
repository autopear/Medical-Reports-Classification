CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 52-year-old woman with a right CP angle mass with obtundation and change in mental status. 
MEDICATIONS: None known. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as lethargic but somewhat responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly disorganized and diffusely slow with a mixture of rhythmic paroxysmal theta and arrhythmic delta activity.  There is both prominent eye movement artifact as well as triphasic waves and occasional sharp waves identified in the right or left frontal region.  
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an increase in theta. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing with shifting arrhythmic slowing.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function affecting both hemispheres.  Despite the right CP angle resection, there is arrhythmic delta activity identified from both sides.  Correlation with imaging may be of use.
