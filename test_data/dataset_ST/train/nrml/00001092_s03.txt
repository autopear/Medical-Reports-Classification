focal slow and sharp wave rare spike from the right hemispher are seen subclin seizur are seen at 12 13 and 12 54 the patient is asleep lie on one side train of high amplitud left anterior tempor spike and slow wave activ are identifi the onset is relat clear at 12 54 but the off set is bit more complic although it is clear over by 12 59 am similar discharg is note at 00 16 44 stage ii sleep is character by spindl and can be seen at 24 am the focal epileptiform activ is again seen at this time long-term eeg monitor march 2006 to march 2006 medic topiram valproat and other introduct continu video eeg monitor is perform in the unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg practic push button were record but no clinic seizur were observ by the patient or caregiv descript of the record the seizur file demonstr intermitt prolong burst of spike and slow wave and focal slow from the left in some case these are on the order of minut but there is no clear postict slow or off set although there are also portion where this activ has disappear random wake and sleep the patient is drowsi throughout much of the record the wake record at time demonstr rhythmic background slow with primarili theta frequenc pattern and at other time there are left tempor sharp wave or spike long-term eeg monitor march 2006 to march 2006 seizur time 16 08 the patient is in bed lie on his left side he had some occasion automat in contrast to previous section of the record there seem to be an initi hz posterior domin rhythm identifi there is fair amount of background muscl artifact and the eeg is best review with both 60 hz and 35 hz filter it is note that at 16 05 the patient seem to be awak but he is in his usual state of delta he has some spontan movement which would suggest that the presenc of the to hz alpha frequenc activ is actual patholog in this patient becaus the first chang actual resembl normal cerebr activ it is bit difficult to be entir certain where the seizur begin at 16 06 the background slow is note from the right but the left seem to be bit more attenu at 16 07 there are rhythmic repetit sharp wave from the left this is more prolong discharg and has some evid for frequenc evolut the alpha frequenc activ appear at 16 07 47 dure this time there are no clear clinic correl for this event howev at 16 08 17 the activ that look like normal alpha activ is like patholog in this individu at 16 08 28 the right arm movement are identifi they are initi non-specif but then are somewhat repetit they do produc some artifact surpris more so than one would expect the repetit circular movement continu they are at time almost slow and intermitt and at 16 08 46 there is background of alpha frequenc activ bilater with rhythmic to hz activ pick up in the t1-t2 electrod the activ seem to be slow with bit more arrhythm delta activ particular in the tempor region with some field of spread to the right at 16 08 54 the patient remain lie on his left side pay attent to the left with sporad jerk in the minut that follow the background at 16 10 may be slower than previous identifi addit high amplitud left anterior tempor spike are seen at 16 10 which is non-sustain burst an individu enter and leav the room at 16 13 the individu can be heard on camera and seem to be just off camera mr davi is note to be somewhat tremul and that individu observ may be what led to the nurs enter the room at 16 19 and push the button mr davi appear confus in this section of the record with the caregiv hold his hand random wake and sleep much of the drowsi record is pattern of theta with small amount of beta the train of sharp wave and spike seen from the left were not seen at those other time clinic note the precis descript of the behavior describ in the nurs note is not possibl to defin in the sleep record there were occasion sharp wave note from the right with some independ right and left tempor sharp wave the alpha frequenc activ pick up in the clinic seizur seen at 16 07 was not seen at ani other time and differ substanti from other portion of the record some of which do demonstr sustain left tempor discharg there are occasion left tempor sharp wave but the major are from the right long-term eeg monitor march 2006 to march 2006 descript of the record the background eeg demonstr promin portion of the record with rhythmic continu theta and sharpli contour slow as well as sharp wave from the left tempor region these includ 14 37 when the patient get up to go to the bathroom at that time there doe seem to be some frequenc evolut the patient is with the nurs who note no clinic chang while the patient is off camera in the bathroom the eeg activ doe seem to acceler and afterward the rhythmic slow and sharp wave are less promin singl channel artifact is then pick up at 14 46 push button for this 24-hour section are review and no seizur are seen in associ with the push button the overnight record for the patient is remark for sequenti loss of electrod and great amount of artifact review the seizur detect file no addit seizur are identifi long-term eeg monitor march 2006 to march 2006 descript of the record the patient has multipl push button when he is in need of thing these includ 27 am 11 00 11 02 and 13 35 this section of the record includ mani stellat detect all of which are artifact there are portion of the record with rhythmic mix theta and delta seizur time 10 28 45 the patient is in bed on the morn of the 5th he was previous asleep in stage ii sleep with vertex wave complex and spindl in the time sampl previous to this includ 10 24 there are train of spike and slow wave and sharp wave seen from the left tempor region there are rare sharp wave identifi from the right immedi prior to the discharg there is some focal slow and sharp wave but not as persist in natur as seen in other epoch of the record the first ictal chang is seen at 10 28 45 with burst of low voltag alpha beta frequenc activ this is in the left mid-to-posterior tempor region spread to the posterior tempor region at 10 28 55 and then to the anterior tempor region ten second later the patient is lie on his side under the sheet it is difficult to know which hand start to trembl but onc the head start to move at 10 29 25 it is clear that it is the right hand 20 second later the right hand extend and there are circular movement the right hand and then right leg demonstr tonic and then tonic-clon activ at 10 29 55 more general tonic-clon activ is seen ten second later by 10 32 25 the ictal activ start to slow with rhythmic paroxysm slow the seizur demonstr clear paroxysm pattern with slow and great deal of muscl and movement artifact the precis end of the seizur is part obscur by muscl and movement artifact but it seem to be over by 10 33 35 the patient has prolong and profound postict period with background slow the video indic prolong period where he is tri to sit up he seem to be have difficulti use his right side and he fall backward in bed he start slide out of bed at 10 39 05 and at 10 40 06 fall on the floor short after this the clinic team enter and note that the patient is confus and cannot answer question lucid as the patient recov he is lie in bed and again the left tempor sharp and slow wave activ is identifi the total seizur durat for this individu is approxim four minut with relat prolong onset prior to the first ictal chang with clear scalp local in the tempor region seizur time 18 10 the patient is sit in chair at 18 12 33 the nurs enter and hand the patient someth he take medicin and swallow at 18 12 41 at 18 12 48 he has cup of water and medicin in his hand the nurs is at the bedsid at 18 12 54 there is clear chang in frequenc of the background with this rhythmic faster alpha frequenc activ the patient is sit the nurs is partial obscur the patient he seem to have some automat behavior on the right and the left the nurs can determin that someth is wrong at 18 13 02 when he has an abrupt motor movement unfortun the nurs reach across to help the patient and obscur the camera view of the patient the nurs on the camera indic that there is rapid clonic activ at 18 13 11 the video indic that this is on the right the patient seem to have partial impair of awar at 18 13 30 and 40 seem tri to help the nurs but then by 18 13 45 this is much more general with vocal the clinic team complet obscur the patient but behind them he seem to be have tonic-clon seizur this seem to be asymmetr with much more signific tonic-clon activ on the right compar to the left the activ demonstr frequenc evolut start to slow at 18 14 25 the patient remain slump to the left side at 18 14 36 the precis end of this seizur is littl difficult to determin it is abat by 18 15 24 and is clear over by 18 15 33 total seizur durat is three minut postict there is fair amount of slow in the background the ekg lead is obscur random wake and sleep there is fair amount of movement artifact when the patient is up and out of bed the overal background when he is awak is slow on the right and intermitt from the left hemispher there are burst and train of left tempor focal slow and spike most of which are in the mid-to-anterior tempor region there are also occasion spike and slow wave complex note from the right particular in the posterior tempor region this section of the overnight record is remark for fair amount of wake captur late at night on one or two occas he doe seem to have an alpha rhythm on the right the ekg lead is uninterpret notabl in this section of the record are frequent left tempor spike review of this section of the record use the stellat seizur detect softwar identifi no addit clinic seizur with burst of fast activ from the left tempor region
