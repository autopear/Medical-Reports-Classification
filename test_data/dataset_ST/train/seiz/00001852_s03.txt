clinic histori 44 year old man with recurr seizur medic vimpat phenobarbit and topamax reason for studi seizur introduct digit video long-term eeg was perform use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterior tempor and single-lead ekg electrod the patient was record dure wake and sleep activ procedur were not perform continu spike detect softwar as well as seizur detect softwar and nurs alarm note event were use to review the eeg technic difficulti none descript of the record the record open to well-defin posterior domin rhythm of to 10 hz which is reactiv to eye open there is normal amount of frontocentr beta activ procedur were not perform the patient is record in wake and stage stage ii and deeper stage of sleep abnorm discharg focal sharp wave at f7 t3 seen occasion in wake and sleep focal slow wave seen at f7 t3 at to hz and an amplitud of 20 to 60 microvolt seizur seizur 07 18 2012 at 10 30 complex partial seizur in the video the patient sudden place down his cell phone sudden his arm rais and he lay back after this the right arm sudden becom dyston and stiff he start have automat movement with the left arm play around with the cell phone and the sheet and his face remain in stare fashion at time he move his mouth he continu this behavior dure the entireti of the seizur eeg the eeg seizur start at 10 33 and end at 10 34 the eeg correl to the seizur start at second after the clinic onset there is rhythmic theta discharg seen maxim at the begin at t1 f7 which evolv in frequenc and increas in amplitud it remain main over the t1 f7 electrod but it spread throughout the whole left hemispher after the end of the seizur there appear to be an asymmetri of the faster frequenc with lack of them over the left hemispher end of seizur seizur complex partial seizur occur on 07 19 2012 start at 48 57 end at 49 52 video behavior while in bed the patient start blink and move his mouth sudden his right arm becom dyston and his right eye shut down and appear to twitch slight while he continu to move his mouth second later he start have rhythmic automat of the left hand and play with the sheet he continu this behavior until the end of the seizur eeg about 10 second after clinic onset the eeg reveal well-form rhythmic hz theta discharg maxim over the t1 f7 electrod which is slight obscur by muscl artifact which appear to continu to evolv in frequenc and increas in amplitud over the left hemispher the seizur remain on the left hemispher it doe not cross to the right after the end of the seizur there appear to be lot of faster frequenc over that left hemispher and not notic over the right the seizur last for 55 second end of seizur seizur electrograph seizur dure the record he had about distinct electrograph seizur which were compris of rhythmic run of f7 t3 theta discharg that appear to increas slight in amplitud and then sudden stop these event last as long as minut dure them in the video there is no clear clinic correl end of seizur impress abnorm eeg due to left anterior tempor sharp wave and slow complex partial seizur and multipl electrograph seizur clinic correl this long-term eeg is diagnost of local relat epilepsi with seizur aris from the left anterior tempor region
