reason for studi differenti and classif of seizur clinic histori this is 48-year-old man with past histori of drug abus and head trauma in the 1980s who present with refractori epilepsi here for differenti and classif medic dure this 24 hour the patient keppra was held off singl dose of 100 mg of topamax was given and he was on depakot technic difficulti none introduct long-term eeg was perform for 24 hour use 10-20 electrod placement system with the addit of anterior tempor and ekg electrod the patient was record dure wake and sleep activ procedur were not perform descript of the record the record reveal posterior domin rhythm that reach hz which is reactiv to eye open there is normal frontocentr beta the patient is record dure wake and sleep no activ procedur were perform abnorm discharg focal sharp wave were seen frequent in sleep and occasion in wake at f8 t2 much more frequent than f7 t3 focal slow was seen intermitt and at time veri rhythmic at f8 t2 at frequenc of 2-4 hz and amplitud of 20-50 microvolt at time there was also seen at f7 t3 seizur the first complex partial seizur occur at 11 35 electrograph there appear to be an onset with rhythmic sharp wave note at t2 in the theta frequenc that increas in amplitud and becam more rhythmic as well as increas frequenc spread throughout the right hemispher in about second spread to the left tempor lobe follow by the hemispher then slowli becom slower in frequenc into the delta rang and final be obscur by muscl artifact after the event there appear to be diffus slow throughout the record clinic the patient remain asleep dure the entireti of the electrograph seizur but onc the electrograph seizur end he get up and start fumbl with the sheet and stand up and start fumbl with the cabl at one point he press the alarm and when the nurs come he doe not realiz that he had press the button it is not clear if he was awar of ani of the event and he was not formal test at that moment complex partial seizur number occur at 12 13 32 again occur while the patient is asleep the eeg reveal rhythmic t2 sharp wave discharg that increas in amplitud and in frequenc to the theta rang and becom more rhythmic as it spread through the right hemispher about second later it start to spread to the left anterior tempor region out of f7 t3 and then continu to spread to the rest of the hemispher and second later it is obscur by muscl artifact the entir seizur last 54 second after the electrograph seizur there is diffus slow seen throughout the entir eeg clinic the patient appear to be asleep throughout the electrograph seizur howev about second after the electrograph seizur end he wake get up from the bed and sit up on all extrem fumbl and look around and jerk back and forth and at time side to side about or minut later he get out of bed and start pull on the cabl final he remov all the cabl from his head the rn notic this about 10 minut later and come into the room where he appear to not rememb what happen and think that he was just go to the bathroom he was not clinic test either at this point impress abnorm eeg due to right anterior tempor seizur in addit to bilater anterior tempor sharp wave seen slight more promin on the right anterior tempor region than the left main in sleep heart rate 84 clinic correl this eeg is consist with diagnosi of local relat epilepsi with seizur possibl aris from either anterior tempor lobe this eeg captur seizur that appear to aris from the right anterior tempor region in addit there is evid of focal cerebr dysfunct in the bilater anterior tempor region which is nonspecif with regard to the etiolog
