CLINICAL HISTORY: 78-year-old woman with confusion and agitation following 
headache, diabetes, hypertension and occipital hemorrhage. 
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Dilantin, Keppra, Zofran 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somewhat confused 
and agitated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes an awake pattern 
with alpha and theta frequency activity best represented in the right. There are 
intermittent bursts of delta which are bilateral and somewhat maximal in the frontal 
regions, but with more of a posterior spread on the left. As the recording continues, 
there is a mixture of theta and rhythmic or arrhythmic delta from either hemisphere, but 
more arrhythmic delta on the left. With the use of a circle montage and asymmetry in 
the occipital regions, left versus right, is sometimes observed. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing improving somewhat by the close of the record. 
2. Bihemispheric delta, but more remarkable in the left hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports the diffuse disturbance of cerebral 
function although there are features relevant to the left hemisphere. This EEG is more 
supportive of a bihemispheric process than an occipital lobe process. There are no 
epileptiform features. If seizures are an important consideration, a followup EEG is 
advised.
