	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	53 year-old man with complex partial epilepsy and CVA with change of mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, ASA, Lisinopril,  Lipitor, Nitro Tab
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 EKG. Awake and asleep study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is slowing of background at 7.8 to just reaching 8 Hz of alpha.  Better organization is seen as the record continues on wakefulness. Drowsiness is seen with increasing slowness.   Deeper stages of sleep are seen with spindles, vertex waves.  There is some shifting slowness with mild theta seen.
	HR:	88 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Posterior rhythm slowness.
	2. 	Shifting slowing with mild theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is no epileptiform activity in the record.   Mild shifting slow wave may be consistent with previous structural lesion and consistent with history of asthma.   If there is more concern of seizures, would consider redoing the study.
