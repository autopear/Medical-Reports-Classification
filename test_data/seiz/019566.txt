CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 74-year-old woman found unresponsive with two first-ever seizures in the setting of UTI. Occipital ischemic changes.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is somewhat lethargic.  The background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and delta.  There is a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, 20 uV.  There is a right frontal sharp and slow wave or discrete sharp wave identified.  This has a variable field of spread and may involve C4 and on one or two occasions T4.  In addition, superimposed in the frontal region, there is more prominent arrhythmic delta activity, a bit more remarkable on the right than the left.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Right frontal sharp waves, some of which demonstrated an unusual morphology and with spread to the right temporal or central regions.  
Superimposed right greater than left frontal arrhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter, as well as a localization-related mechanism for this patient’s seizures.  A follow-up study as this patient’s infectious problems improve may be helpful to assess the background slowing.
