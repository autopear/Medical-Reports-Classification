CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 86-year-old, right-handed woman with a past stroke involving the right side of the body, acute hyponatremia complicated by an event with generalized shaking perhaps more so on the left than the right without loss of consciousness and left-sided weakness.  
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dilantin, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with generous background beta and a difficult to discern posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are prominent bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity, some of which are a bit more remarkable on the left compared to the right.  Stimulation of the patient elicits an alerting response.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Prominent bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity in the temporal regions in drowsiness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no definite epileptiform features identified in this record and no major focal features.  Additional imaging may be helpful in terms of localizing her symptoms.
