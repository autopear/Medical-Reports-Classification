CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis C, with recent seizures treated with Dilantin and Ativan.  
MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Clonidine, antifungal agents.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous and includes a mixed frequency pattern of theta and smaller amounts of delta.  The overall pattern is symmetric.  Stimulation of the patient does not produce a significant change in the background.  On occasion, there is some shifting asymmetries in terms of the quantity of delta in the posterior region.  Towards the close of the record, there are occasional right central sharp waves identified in the record.  Although there are no clinical changes in the background towards the close of the record, the background is overall richer in alpha and theta frequency activity.
HR:  116 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing, improving to some extent throughout the course of the record. 
Focal sharp waves in the right central region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a localization-related mechanism for this patientâ€™s seizures.  The improvement in the background noted by the close of the record may be part of a postictal state.
