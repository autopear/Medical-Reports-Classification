CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman with epilepsy, schizophrenia, COPD admitted with multiple complex partial seizures, drug interactions. Previously seizure free.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin,  Dilantin, Hydralazine, Ciprofloxacin, Percocet
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel of EKG. The date of this patient's seizures is not provided.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness background EEG includes an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm on the right, disrupted on the left. The left hemisphere includes arrhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude periodic sharp wave, maximum at T2 with a generous field of spreading involving the total of T3, T5 and F7. As the recording continues and the patient is stimulated this arrhythmic delta activity in the sharp waves waxes and wanes. The sharp waves may occur in bursts and trains but none last more than 10 seconds. The patient drifts into stage  1  sleep with vertex waves. The focal sharp wave contoured delta, focal slowing and sharp waves persist. There is a generous field of spread both for the sharp waves and to the focal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, more so on the right.
	HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Prominent focal slowing from the left temporal region.
	2.	Prominent left temporal sharp waves, sometimes periodic, sometimes occurring in trains.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports a highly irritative focus and a localization related mechanism to epilepsy. Please pull previous studies for comparison to this record.
