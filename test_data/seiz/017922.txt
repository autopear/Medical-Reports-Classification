HISTORY: 53-year-old male with epilepsy for five years, has 1 seizure per month. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a symmetric, reactive 9.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Occasional vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  In drowsiness, there are a handful of small sharp waves identified in the right mid-to-anterior temporal region.  These may occur in couplets, and are associated with some rhythmic theta.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing with small discrete sharp waves identified from the right mid-temporal region in drowsiness. 
		
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While the discrete sharp waves have the morphology of a benign epileptiform variant, these are seen more frequently than would be acceptable for that variant and would therefore be considered epileptogenic.
