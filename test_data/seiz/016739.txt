CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old gentleman, agitated and intubated with COPD, HIV, CVA with left posterior parietal infarct.  Previous EEG 3/6/03.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Bactrim, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake and intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the EEG is obscured by muscle and movement artifact.  The overall pattern is low voltage with a suggestion of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is some shifting mixed theta and delta activity seen from the central regions bilaterally with some spread to the parietal and centrotemporal regions.  
HR:  N/A.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Modest, generalized background slowing.
Persistent focal slowing from the central regions shifting from the left to right central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record is not significantly changed from the previous study.  No seizures were recorded and no epileptiform activity was seen.
