CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 62-year-old male with a history of head trauma and V-tach arrest, still intubated in a hard collar in the ICU.  This is a follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Valproate.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, lethargic, and was sedated the night before.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow, low voltage.  There is a arrhythmic delta activity identified from the left hemisphere particularly in the temporal regions, with an occasional left temporal sharp wave or higher amplitude, sharply contoured delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces a great deal of artifact, and briefly produces an increase in theta frequency activity in the background.  There is spontaneous movement in the record and some portions of the record show more theta frequency activity than others.   There are brief portions in the record where there are elements of sleep and vertex waves and central beta frequency activity.  The epileptiform activity is a bit less prominent at that time.  
HR:  74 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing and sharp waves from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous records, this EEG is markedly improved. There are now sleep and wake cycles, no seizures were recorded, and the epileptiform activity is vastly decreased.
