CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 42-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy, head trauma, left craniotomy four years ago, hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, admitted with a seizure and found to have dizziness and pneumonia.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, multiple antibiotics. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation.  Previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of beta and a small amount of excess theta activity. There is an area of subtle, focal delta in the left frontocentral region, as well as a breach rhythm in this same region.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a weak driving response with some shifting asymmetries.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Mild excess background theta. 
	Mild excess background beta.
	Subtle focal slowing from the left frontocentral/frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen.  This EEG supports a structural abnormality in the region of this patientâ€™s previous craniotomy.  The mild background slowing is a non-specific finding and may be seen in multiple different clinical scenarios including postictal state or a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
