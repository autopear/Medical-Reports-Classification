CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year-old male who was transferred for right parietal occipital 
hemorrhage and had a tonic-clonic seizure. The patient was found in an outside 
institution seizing. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient ranges from being awake to sleep 
and snoring. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a continuous 
pattern with diffuse beta and smaller amounts of alpha frequency activity. There is a 
subtle asymmetry with a bit of low voltage delta activity observed in the right posterior 
temporal and central parietal region. Stimulation of the patient produces a spontaneous 
arousal with an increase in alpha activity, but additional awake recording was not 
achieved. 
HR: 104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with beta frequency activity. 
2. Subtle focal delta in the right posterior quadrant congruent with the patient's 
imaging. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
