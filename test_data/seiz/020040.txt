CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 47-year-old male in a motor vehicle accident with loss of consciousness and witnessed seizures.  CAT scan showed a small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and a left posterior hemorrhage. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ceftriaxone, Haldol, and Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and occasionally agitated during the record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric, diffusely slow, and low voltage with a mixture of frequencies.  Generalized beta activity is seen.  Two bursts of delta activity were seen in the left temporal area.  The patient is likely to wake up at the end of the record. THIS MAKES NO SENSE AND NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED ISNâ€™T THIS THE SECTION WHERE THE PATEINT WAKES UP?
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow, low voltage background with a mixed frequency background.
Generalized beta activity.
Two bursts of delta activity seen in the left temporal area.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG pattern is consistent with relatively light pharmacological sedation.  The generalized beta activity may be due to Ativan.  The two bursts of delta activity seen in the left temporal region may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform discharges were identified in this record.  When the patient is conscious and stable, a repeat EEG in the lab may be helpful.
