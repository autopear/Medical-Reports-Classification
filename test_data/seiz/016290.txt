CLINICAL HISTORY:   19-year-old right-handed with epilepsy since 2004, last big seizure was in August 2007 with loss of consciousness and confusion, but multiple little seizures throughout the week, which last two to three minutes, in which he feels tense and sweating.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation photic stimulation is performed. This is a 1 hour sleep-deprived study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There are brief portions of the record where the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  With even mild relaxation, there is an increase in data and irregularity to the record. In this sharply contoured background, there are bursts of irregular, sharply contoured activity with an underlying phase reversal at T3-T1.  This is seen occasionally in relaxed wakefulness, slightly in hyperventilation and then in the transition after hyperventilation to drowsiness.  Hyperventilation produces some bursts of background slowing.  There is an extensive portion of the record with drowsiness with slower rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, vertex waves, and then arousals.  Spindles and K complexes are observed in stage 2 sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
	HR:	96 bpm with an unusual KT complex.
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Somewhat irregular background with irregular data seen bilaterally from the temporal
regions.
	2.	In a sharply contoured record, irregular shock waves or sharply contoured data are
observed with a maximum at T1 or T3, but with a relatively generous field of spread.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
Additional montage was maybe helpful in characterizing
epileptiform activity.  This EEG supports a localization related mechanism, as well as a biÂ­
hemispheric disturb of the cerebral function.
