CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 35-year-old woman with post-traumatic epilepsy, previously with multiple seizures per month now with less frequent complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In much of the waking record, the background EEG includes a symmetric, reactive 9.25 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is also some theta identified in the background.  On rare occasions in wakefulness, there is excess background theta when the patient does not appear to be drowsy.  On one or two occasions this seems to be asymmetric, maximum on the right, and there does appear to be disruption of the alpha rhythm from the right.  Hyperventilation produces symmetric, background theta activity. Drowsiness again is associated with an increase in background theta, but there are portions of the record where the patient seems to be awake where there is intermittent theta seen diffusely.  
Photic stimulation elicits a well-formed driving response, with driving identified at 1 Hz faster flash frequencies. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Excess background theta in apparent wakefulness.
Occasional asymmetry with more rhythmic theta from the right hemisphere and on rare occasions this is seen with disruption of the alpha on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features may be correlated with the patientâ€™s imaging, but consideration for a process involving the right hemisphere would be appropriate.
