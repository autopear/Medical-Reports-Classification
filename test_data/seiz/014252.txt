CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 79-year-old male with right occipital stroke, previous stroke while driving.  Right carotid stenosis, head and neck cancer, orthostatic hypotension, and possible epilepsy.  Patient presented with a Dilantin level of 20.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is intermittent shifting arrhythmic theta or delta seen from either hemisphere.  On one occasion, there is disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right, but this is not a consistent finding.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing, as well as an increase in arrhythmic delta. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving at faster flash frequencies.   
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Excess background theta.
	Shifting arrhythmic delta.
	Rare portions of the record with disruption of the alpha on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both hemispheres including white matter in both hemispheres. No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Given the abnormal MRI findings, there is less in the way of localizing features than one might expect.
