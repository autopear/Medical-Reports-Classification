CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 23-month-old male who presents with status epilepticus for 25 minutes with eye deviating to the left with left-sided shaking followed by tonic-clonic seizure activity.  Patient is a 24-week preemie.  From birth to 8 months with multiple abdominal surgeries and other medical complications.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and steroids.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the child is intubated in the ICU.  His eyes are opened, and he has jittering movements in all extremities, upper more so than lower.  He startled to auditory stimulation.  As time goes on, the patient’s jittering type of movement calms down and there is some sucking artifact.  The background EEG is a high amplitude, chaotic pattern with delta activity of 1 to 2 Hz.  
Vecuronium is given at 9:18, and afterwards the muscle artifact significantly decreases.  There is slower delta with a frequency of 0.6 to 1 Hz.  There is a brief portion of fast activity in the frontal regions.  This occurs after the Vecuronium is given and is not associated with a change in the patient’s behavior.  It picked up what appeared to be either eye leads or frontal electrodes.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Markedly abnormal background with slow delta.
	Absence of the appropriate developmental milestones for a child of this age. 
	Frontal fast activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  This pattern can be seen following acute, severe seizures or in the context of severe disturbance of gray and white matter.  The frontal fast activity may be epileptiform in nature. Additional EEG recording may be valuable to support additional subclinical seizures.
