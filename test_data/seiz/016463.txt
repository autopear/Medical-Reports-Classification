CLINICAL HISTORY: 47-year-old woman with epilepsy for the past 15 years after she 
was hit by a car while intoxicated. Seizures are not controlled and occur frequently with 
an aura of weakness, dizziness, loose of consciousness and tonic clonic activity, 
weekly. Past history of heart failure, hypertension, schizophrenia, HIV disease and 
obesity. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Cogentin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement -and with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. 
The patient had very knotted and dirty hair. This was the second attempt to complete 
this EEG and, therefore, the technologist did not reschedule. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE In wakefulness, background EEG is low voltage, 
but there is 9 hertz symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm. The initial portions of 
the record demonstrate a small amount of background theta, but later portions of the 
record when she is maximally awake demonstrate a relatively well organized awake 
pattern with less in the way of background theta. Vertex K complexes, spindles and 
posts are observed in sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling 
off to sleep, but there is a driving response. Toward the close for the record, there is a 
bit of amplitude asymmetry and a some subtle left theta. 
Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: 
1. Background slowing and disorganization seen in the initial portion of the record. 
2. A subtle asymmetry in this low voltage record with a bit more theta on the left 
compared to the right. 
CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The subtle features 
described above should be taken with consideration given the technical issues in terms 
of electrode placement due to the patient's knotted hair.
