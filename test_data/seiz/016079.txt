CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 87-year-old woman was admitted for left-sided weakness. The patient is admitted for seizures and to also find leftÂ­ sided weakness.
	MEDICATIONS:	Tylenol,Remeron, Nexium,Aricept,Heparin, Hydralazine,Lorazepam,dilantin and K-OUR
	INTRODUCTION:	Digital video EEG performed in the EEG laboratory on the floor using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1- channel EKG. The patient is confused during the record. Hypoventilation is not performed. Photic stimulation was completed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:	The background EEG is significantly disorganized with excessive high voltage delta and theta activity. The normal posterior alpha rhythm cannot be identified. Frequently PLEOS like activity was seen in the right hemisphere with frequency about a
1 Hz to 0.5 Hz with phase reverse at C4 area. No sleeping stages were
achieved in this tracing. The patient talked and moved during tracing. Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Significant disorganized background with excessive delta and theta
activity.
	2.	PLEOS like activity in the right temporal area.
3. Absence of alpha activity.
	CLINICAL CORRELATIONS: 	This tracing is indicative of severe cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter as well as the deeper nuclei in the midline structure. The right PLEOS like activity can be seen in structural region such as stroke. Correlation with neural imaging studies may be helpful. In addition, the PLEOS like activity can also suggest localization mechanisms for epilepsy in this patient.
