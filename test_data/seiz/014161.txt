CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old woman with subdural hematoma status post MVA with right craniectomy in December, intracerebral hemorrhage and seizures, also a history of cardiac disease. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Zetia, Metformin, Aetas, Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Amlodipine, Neuontin, Percocet, Levothyroxine, Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8 hertz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. In addition, there is focal, arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere maximum in the temporal region. 
At times there is delta with disruption of the faster frequency activity and a subtle right anterior temporal sharp wave. As the patient becomes drowsy, there are bursts of arrhythmic delta activity identified primarily in the right hemisphere. There is wicket activity, but the subtle, sharp waves can be differentiated from wicket by the presence of after-going slow waves. There is also an alpha asymmetry and in later portion of the record the alpha rhythm on the right reaches 
9 hertz, but remains slow on the left. Features of drowsiness including increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits driving bilaterally. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing in the right hemisphere, maximum in the temporal region with arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity. 
2. Occasional right anterior temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right involving gray and white matter. The sharp waves are congruent with a previous injury and suggest an increased tendency towards seizures.
