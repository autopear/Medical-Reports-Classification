CLINICAL  IDSTORY:  This is a 59-year-old individual with myoclonic jerks in the right arm and face. History of hypotension and unresponsiveness. Status-post trache and PEG.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video BEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was experiencing facial jerking during the BEG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE  RECORD:  The background BEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with rhythmic theta and arrhythmic delta activity. There is more arrhythmic delta activity seen in the central regions than the temporal regions.   Although there is muscle jerk artifact with a myoclonus, there is an underlying left centroparietal focus.
HR:  84BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Replacement of normal background with a slow pattern with a significant amount of arrhythmic delta activity in the central regions.
2.  Left centroparietal spike focus.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform activity does not correlate with the myoclonic  jerking.    Additional  studies  may  be  helpful  to  determine  if  there is  an
.underlying epileptiform focus.
