INTRODUCTION: Digital video BEG is perf01med in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were perfom1ed. This is a11 awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is continuous and well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.   Hyperventilation does not significar1tly alter the record.  In drowsiness there is occasional slowing identified from both temporal regions. Photic stimulation elicits a symmetric driving response.
HR: 96BPM
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness. 
 
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: No focal_ or epileptiform features were seen. Normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is a- clinical concern, a repeat tracing is recommended.
