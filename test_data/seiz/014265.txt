CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old woman with hypertension, anemia, chronic kidney disease, found to have a seizure.  The patient suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage with intraventricular spread.   Ventriculostomy was put in the right hemisphere.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Nicardipine, Hydralazine,  Insulin, Pantroprazole, Labetalol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins a diffusely slow background is seen with theta and delta activity. Theta is seen reaching 5 Hz. An interhemispheric asymmetry is seen with higher amplitudes seen in the left hemisphere.   During stimulation reactivity is seen with some increase in theta activity, but is variable.
HR:  84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Slowing of the background with a theta delta pattern.
	2. 	Interhemispheric asymmetry with higher amplitudes seen in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen on this record. The overall slowing of the background is consistent with a diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Despite the ventriculostomy placement on the right hemisphere, an
interhemispheric asymmetry with higher amplitude is seen on the left.
