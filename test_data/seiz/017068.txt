CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old male with a history of CHF, hypertension, stroke, and substance abuse who presents with chest pain. The patientâ€™s seizures started during transportation to Temple. MRI shows brain stem stroke.  This is a follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Nitroglycerin, Dilantin, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive during the recording. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates continuous low voltage diffuse beta activity.  The EEG is intermixed with a small amount of delta activity mostly in the central region.  Painful stimulation did not change the pattern..  
HR:  114 BPM, irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuously low voltage and diffuse beta activity.
	2.	Stimulation did not activate the EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No localized or epileptiform abnormalities  were identified This EEG pattern is consistent with severe cerebral dysfunction.  This EEG pattern is suggestive of a poor prognosis.
