CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old woman with new onset seizures with left-sided tonic-clonic movements for about three minutes.  Past medical history includes multiple sclerosis and bipolar disorder.  Patient is non-communicative with a neurogenic bladder.  CAT scan of the brain showed right periventricular hypodensity. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Neurontin, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow and disorganized with a 7 Hz, 20 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a moderate amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Frequent PLEDS at 25 Hz were seen in the T1 and T4 regions.  No physical seizures were observed on the video and the patient is awake and responsive with spontaneous movements. 
HR:  144 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow and disorganized background.
Right mid-temporal PLEDS.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates PLEDS activity, which is suggestive of a structural lesion and consistent with the findings on the CT scan of the brain.  However, the patient is not in status.  The preliminary results of this EEG were communicated to the Neurology Team and the resident on call.  If clinically indicated, a follow-up EEG is recommended.
