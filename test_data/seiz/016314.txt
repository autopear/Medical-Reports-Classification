CLINICAL HISTORY: 49-year-old right handed woman with increasing blackout spells lasting 30-60 seconds with decreasing responsiveness, confusion. No motor activity. No loss of consciousness. Hypertension, diabetes, stroke 7 years ago with baseline right hem iparesis. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Lorazepam & Aspirin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized with 10 Hertz, 30 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in background theta. Intermittent bursts of theta are identified in drowsiness. Spontaneous arousals are noted from relaxed wakefulness. 
Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does elicit scant driving. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness. 
Clinical correlation: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. A handful of normal variants including lambda waves were identified. These are normal features.
