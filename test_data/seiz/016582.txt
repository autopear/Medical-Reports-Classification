CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 69-year-old gentleman with dialysis, missed dialysis and had cardiac arrest of unknown duration of time. He has a lifelong history of epilepsy with family history of epilepsy treated with Dilantin and Carbamazepine.  Slurred speech and transient focal features were noted on presentation.
MEDICATIONS: 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is now extubated and has a facemask. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is maximally awake, the background EEG is diffusely slow with rhythmic theta frequency activity and occasional bursts of frontally predominant delta activity.  In this background, there are some shifting asymmetries.  There are some subtle asymmetries, as well as occasional right frontal or right mid-temporal sharp waves.  The sharp waves range from discrete morphology to more higher amplitude spike and slow waves, as well as some sharply contoured theta/delta.  
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  
HR:  102 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing, as well as rhythmic, synchronous background slowing.
FIRDA.
Right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the metabolic problems described above, a follow-up EEG may be helpful in characterizing this patientâ€™s background.  The right temporal sharp waves support a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  Comparison with his previous EEGs may be helpful to determine if this is his usual EEG pattern or a new pattern.
