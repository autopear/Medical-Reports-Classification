CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 22-year-old male with anoxic injury following drug overdose. The date of this patient’s anoxic injury is not known. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording opens, the patient is awake and somewhat agitated.  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with generous muscle artifact.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is some background slowing and a vertex wave or two.  The patient is moving about throughout much of the record.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG demonstrates more slow, low voltage delta.  At the close of the record, the patient is increasingly agitated: sitting up, moving about, and uncooperative.  
HR:  126 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Replacement of normal background with a low voltage pattern with some slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a great degree of agitation in wakefulness; therefore, the awake record, which would be most valuable for assessing the background, is uninterpretable.  To put this record in the appropriate clinical context, it is important to know when the patient “overdosed” and whether or not he has been exposed to other CNS-acting agents in recent days.
