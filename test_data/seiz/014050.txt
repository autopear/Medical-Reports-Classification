CLINICAL HISTORY:   46 year-old male with a history of childhood seizures, schizophrenia, hepatitis C. Last seizure was January 17, 2008 with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Depakote and Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed. No hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the patient EEG demonstrates predominately  disorganized background slowing. There are some portions, however, which are organized. The patient does have intermittent alpha waves approximately  7 hertz. The patient does drift into sleep through the record with stage 2 sleep characterized with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles. Photic stimulation is associated with some driving, but no photo paroxysmal response. Heart rate: 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Intermittent background  slowing.
	2. 	Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform activity was seen in this record, however, the background slowing is nonspecific changes which can be seen in patients with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy  and diffuse white matter disease. Clinical correlation is advised.
