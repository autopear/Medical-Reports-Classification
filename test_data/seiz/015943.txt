	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	This is a 25-year-old individual with epilepsy secondary to head trauma following being hit in the head with a bat. The patient had run out of medication resulting in subsequent seizures.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Initially, there was a great deal of movement or other artifacts in the background.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	This is a drowsy individual with multiple spontaneous arousals to and from stage II sleep. The minimal waking background that is recorded appears to be normal. There are a handful of bursts of shifting asymmetry, left more so than right. Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex K complexes, spindles and posts. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling off to sleep.
	HR: 	80 BPM.
		IMPRESSION: 	Mildly abnormal EEG due to shifting and slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	Additional recordings may be helpful
particularly with an awake recording to make sure that the background
is unremarkable.  In addition, additional more prolonged recording may be helpful to resolve the issue of underlying focality in this record.
