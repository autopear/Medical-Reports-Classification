CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old male with new onset seizures found to have HIV infection, hypoglycemia, and a subdural hematoma. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Protonix, thiamin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is restless. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the few moments when the patient is cooperative, there is a 9 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Other portions of the record appear to demonstrate background theta.  There are brief epochs with drowsiness with an increase in background beta.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
	A great deal of muscle and motion artifact, which limits the overall study.
	Excess theta seen intermittently.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The degree of movement artifact could obscure focal or epileptiform activity in this 20-minute record
