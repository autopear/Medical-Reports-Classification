CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 38-year-old male with epilepsy, alcohol abuse, and a left temple arachnoid cyst admitted with seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Ativan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somnolent or uncooperative throughout much of the record.  The overall pattern is rich in beta, as well as some sweat artifact and low voltage delta.  When the patient is maximally awake and alert, there is movement artifact in the background, but there is a suggestion of a well-formed underlying alpha rhythm of approximately 10 Hz.  He coughs and then drifts off to sleep and there is an increase in both beta and theta.  
HR:  132 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited EEG due to sweat and muscle artifact, but abnormal due to: 
Excess beta.
Mild excess delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In this individual with epilepsy and a structural brain abnormality, a repeat EEG in the lab may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity.
