CLINICAL IDSTORY: This is a 66-year-old woman with epilepsy since 1983,  seizure-free for four years. Off of Dilantin for a year.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG  is performed in the Jab using standard 10-20  system of electrode placement with one cha1mel  of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic  stimulation were pe1formed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD:  In  wakefulness, there is a 9.25  Hz,  50  uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.   In  maximal wakefulness, the background EEG  is appropriately organized.   In drowsiness and in the late hyperventilation  record, there is  a bit of irregular theta activity seen  primarily in the  right temporal  region more than the left.   In  addition, in the drowsy pattern, there is  occasional temporal wicket.  Despite the temporal wicket, there are rare left anterior temporal sharp waves identified in this record. These are seen primarily in drowsiness, but on one occasion in stage II sleep.
HR:  96BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
1.   Left temporal sharp waves, which can be identified despite a sharply contoured background with wicket activity in drowsiness. At least one of these waves persists into stage II sleep.
2.   Irregular temporal theta seen primarily in d rowsiness, but also in t he hyperventilation section, right greater than left.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: Correlation with imaging may be helpful in ten11S of integrating these findings with this patient's  history of previous brain injury. The sharp waves suggest a partial or localization mechanism for epilepsy. The tight greater than left temporal irregular theta is considered a non-specific finding in a subject of this age.  The wicket seen in this record is a normal variant.
