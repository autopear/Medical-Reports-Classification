CLINICAL IDSTORY:  This is a 71-year-old, right-handed woman with a previous stroke, an aneurysm clip, and status epilepticus with a confusional spell versus complex partial seizure this morning and then two or three complex partial seizures during the EEG hook-up.   The patient received 4 mg of Ativan with 2 mg just prior to the start of the EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Dilantin, Ativan, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG remains abnormal.   The activity in the right hemisphere is richer than the previous day primarily with rhythmic  theta.   The left hemisphere demonstrates initially a discontinuous pattern with poly spike activity and sharp waves from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions, but with a generous field of spread through the left hemisphere.   Because of the extraordinary irritability of the EEG, the patient is stimulated and evaluated and with stimulation, she clearly has an alerting, interacts, produces a word, and tracks the examiner throughout the room.  When not  stimulated,  as she  drifts  off to sleep,  the epileptiform activity  from the  left hemisphere becomes paroxysmal, at times almost discontinuous and the right hemisphere becomes slower.
HR.: 90BPM.
ll\IIPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Prominent, epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere including focal paroxysmal fast activity or poly spike activity and sharps.
2.  At times almost a discontinuous pattern from the left, particularly when the patient drifts off
to sleep.
3.   Moderate background slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there is new epileptiform activity today in the form of a burst of fast activity, the periodic activity isn't  marching through as much as it had previously and  there  is  a  much  more  vigorous  positive  pattern  to stimulation  with  increase  in  faster frequency  activity  from  both  hemispheres.    This  EEG  supports  a  highly  irritative  process, although it does appear to be improving.
