CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 57-year-old woman who recalls a fall 48 hours ago with back pain and neck pain, but does not remember a seizure. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, morphine, Gabapentin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a small amount of background theta in the awake background.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is occasional slowing from the right or left temporal region. 
Photic stimulation is remarkable for artifact, but no driving. 
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Excess theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patientâ€™s medications may play a role in the theta described above.  No epileptiform features were seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be valuable.
