CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year-old right-handed male with tonic-clonic seizures lasting 
3-5 minutes following an aneurysm repair in 1998. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness background EEG includes an 
intrahemispheric asymmetry. The activity in the right hemisphere is slightly higher 
amplitude than the left. In addition, there is a bit more arrhythmic slowing observed. 
There is a small amount of arrhythmic slowing observed on the right in comparison to 
the left. As the patient becomes drowsy the breech rhythm is a bit more prominent and 
the focal slowing on the right localizes a bit more to the right frontal region. 
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation does elicit 
a scant driving response observed bilaterally. Heart rate 66 bpm. Towards the close of 
the record, high amplitude right frontal central sharp waves are observed. Concomitant 
with this observation, there is additional rhythmic slowing with a right frontal spike and 
after slow wave discharges. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing best defined from the right frontal region. 
2. Right frontal sharp waves and spike wave complexes. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports and underlying structural or functional 
abnormality on the right as well as localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
