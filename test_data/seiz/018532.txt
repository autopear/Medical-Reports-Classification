CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 44-year-old male with headaches, blurry vision, and previous cerebral hemorrhage, but no brain surgery or history of seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness, accentuated somewhat in hyperventilation and in drowsiness, there is subtle, underlying rhythmic activity from the left hemisphere particularly in the left frontocentral and temporal regions.    In 
apparent wakefulness, there is frontally predominant, relatively symmetric rhythmic theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, this also starts to involve the right frontal region.   In stage I sleep, there is attenuation of the alpha rhythm with intermittent, rhythmic, relatively symmetric frontal theta and delta.  Symmetric vertex waves are identified in stage I sleep. 
Photic stimulation is performed at the close of the record  while the patient is drowsy; there is no driving.
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Intermittent focal slowing identified from the left hemisphere in wakefulness and early drowsiness. 
Intermittent portions of the record when the patient is awake but demonstrates rhythmic frontal theta and delta, which in this case would represent slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this record.  This tracing supports an underlying disturbance of cerebral function effecting white matter. This may impact the left hemisphere more than the right.  Correlation with imaging may be useful.
