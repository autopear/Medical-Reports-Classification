CLINICAL HISTORY: 48-year-old woman with scleroderma, multiple strokes. Now 
new stroke characterized by aphasia and right-sided weakness. Past history of seizures 
with left arm shaking. Nasal sarcoma. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Coumadin, Lasix, Lopressor, Penbxyelillne, FES04, Diovan, 
Prilosec, Lantus, Zocor, Metoprolol, Alphagan 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation and 
hyperventilation were not performed. Patient was poorly responsive with frequent eye 
blinking. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is low to medium amplitude, 
lacking in some of the normal morphologies typical for an adult of this age. There is 
intermittent theta from either side and some higher amplitude, more rhythmic theta from 
the left. There is also some delta observed. This may be seen from either side. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1 . Paucity of some of the normal morphology seen in an adult. 
2. Shifting slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. A repeat study in 
the lab is recommended for more complete evaluation.
