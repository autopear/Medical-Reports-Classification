CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 61-year-old woman with headaches, dizziness, difficulty walking, metastatic cancer, and history of smoking. She has a diagnosis of encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, insulin, Colace, Decadron, many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient is noted to have a hair weave, which complicates electrode placement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, there is shifting, arrhythmic delta activity identified from either temporal regions without significant lateralization.  Features of deeper stages of sleep include an increase in background theta with rare vertex waves. 
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR:  84 BPM, frequent PVCs.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
	1.	Occasional shifting, irregular temporal theta and delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The features described above are non-specific.  In a subject of this age, they can be seen in cerebrovascular disease or any bihemispheric disturbance.  Correlation with imaging may be useful. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study is recommended.
