CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 78-year-old gentleman who was in a coma in 1963, following a motor vehicle accident, right temporal craniectomy, seizure-free  since 1965.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin and Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	The  EEG include a well organized common background with a 9 Hz , 40 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm. There is excess diffuse theta. The major abnormalities  in this record include intermittent superimposed rhythmic delta from the left temporal region with occasional left temporal sharp waves. This is accentuated by hyperventilation and is seen intermittently  on other occasions. Most of this slowing from the left temporal region is rhythmic but it is occasionally arrhythmic. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
	HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Mild overall background disorganization.
	2. 	Superimposed rhythmic left temporal theta/delta.
	3. 	Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left, despite the history of previous right craniotomy. Comparison with previous EEGs and imaging may be of use. It may be valuable to know whether or not the epileptiform activity is congruent with that seen in decades past.
