	CLINICAL HISTORY: 	47 year old with hypertension, renal failure, epilepsy since he began dialysis. Last seizure was 2 weeks ago, described as staring and stiffness followed by confusion and drifting off to sleep. Depression, reflux, renal failure.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Catapres, Levsin, Celexa, Norvasc, Ambien, ASA INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow with a 6
Hz posterior dominant rhythm and intermittent bursts of generalized delta. In addition, the patient appears to be drowsy in their intermittent vertex space. The overall record is slow but at the close of photic stimulation at the very end of the last photic driving session, the background does include some activity which reaches 8.5 Hz.
	HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Mild background slowing.
	2. 	Hypersomnolence.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal slowing are
characteristic  of a metabolic  encephalopathy as one might seen in renal failure. There is a brief section with a maximally awake record. Considerations for either a disorder of hypersomnolence or a toxic or metabolic process is advised.
