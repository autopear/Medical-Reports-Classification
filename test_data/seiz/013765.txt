CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 11-year-old male admitted 9/6/04 with first ever tonic-clonic seizure, requiring Ativan without improvement.  Respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Patient found to have left-sided twitching, right arm pit abscess, and cat scratch fever; normal CSF. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, Ativan, Versed, Lidocaine, and Atomodate. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffuse, continuous medium to high amplitude beta.  There are portions of the record with apparent vertex waves.  Stimulation of the patient is associated with occasional sitting up and becoming reactive.  As he sits up, there is a higher amplitude pattern in the background, but a true alert pattern is not achieved.  There is some ICU drip artifact noted.  
HR:  Sometimes irregular, 120 BPM max.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
	1.	Diffuse excess background beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The presence of vertex waves as well as the arousal response in the context of diffuse beta suggests that the pattern described above is a pharmacologic pattern.  To further characterize this childâ€™s epilepsy, a repeat study once his sedation has been discontinued is recommended.
