CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old man with diabetes, coronary artery disease, CHF, DVT, hypertension, COPD, and respiratory failure, with change in status and shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lasix, Lovenox, Lorazepam, Fentanyl, Pantoprazole, INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As this record began, a very disorganized background is seen with no appreciable posterior dominant alpha rhythm. The overall background is very regular with mixed frequencies of beta, theta, and delta. At times there is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity seen. During the record, the patient begins to become sleepy with slowing of the background and some vertex waves, and at that time FIRDA is seen.
	HR: 	90 bpm with PVCs. IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Disorganized  mixed frequency background.
	2. 	Some shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
	3. 	FIRDA
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This background is consistent with a bilateral dysfunction of cerebral activity. This is nonspecific and could be seen in toxic metabolic medication causes of encephalopathy. No epileptiform activity or seizures recorded in this record.
