CLINICAL IDSTORY: This is a 50-year-old male with epilepsy. Seizure-free  since
2002.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is perfmmed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant  rhythm  with  a  small  amount  of  low voltage,  frontocentral  beta  activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
HR:  60 to 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal BEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this
record. Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
