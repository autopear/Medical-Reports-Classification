CLINICAL HISTORY 56 year old man with seizure in 2004 . 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin p.r.n., Coumadin, Atenolol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation performed. 
Awake and asleep study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is mostly a slow posterior 
dominant alpha rhy1hm that ranges from 6.5 to 8 Hz. At times it can enter normal ranges at 9.6 
Hz. During the record there is independent irregular slowing seen in the right or left temporal 
regions. More on the right there is arrhy1hmic delta activity seen in bursts. On the left the delta 
activity is more sharply contoured more in the anterior temporal region. During hyperventilation 
there seems to be more enhancement of both the sharply con\oured delta in the left temporal 
region and the right arrhy1hmic delta activity. There is some minimal driving with Photic 
stimulation. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Some slowing of the posterior dominant alpha rhy1hm, in the 6.5 to 8 range at times. 
2. Independent arrhy1hmic delta activity seen more in the right hemisphere. 
3. Sharply contoured temporal delta seen in the left. 
4. Sharp waves on the left in association with right temporal delta. 
CLINICAL CORREL TION: This record is similar to previous EEG in 2007. The sharply 
contoured delta and sharp waves are consistent with a focus r epilepsy. Consider tangential 
dipole for epileptiform activity during this record.
