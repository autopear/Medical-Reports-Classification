CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 92-year-old woman with diabetes and a pacemaker, found with a change in mental status and a shaking spell.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Labetalol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is lethargic throughout much of the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: With maximal stimulation, the EEG is partially obscured by muscle and motion artifact.  When the patient is allowed to rest comfortably, she drifts off into a drowsy pattern with rhythmic background theta and occasional vertex waves.  Consistently, each attempt to arouse the patient produces muscle artifact, which obscures the EEG.  Two left frontal sharp waves were identified in this record. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Two left frontal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter. In this clinical context, the presence of two left frontal sharp waves may be part of this patientâ€™s dementing illness, but may also support a partial mechanism for epilepsy.
