CLINICAL HISTORY:  7-year-old  right-handed male who had his second seizure on
10/06/2007.  The patient complained  that he started drooling, dropped down and became incontinent.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital: Video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE R ECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is acceptably organized for a child of this age with a 8 hertz posterior dominant rhythm.   In this bedside portable record, there are occasional shifting asymmetries. The asymmetry includes  an occasional disruption of alpha rhythm on the left in comparison to the right. In addition, as the child becomes  drowsy, the alpha seems to drop off earlier on the left with rare bursts of 3-5 hertz activity on the left. Hyperventilation does not clearly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits driving response.
HR:  108 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Subtly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle disruption of alpha rhythm activity on the left.
CLINICAL COURSE:   No epileptiform features were identified.  Correlation with imaging may be of value, given the subtle disruption of alpha frequency on the left.
