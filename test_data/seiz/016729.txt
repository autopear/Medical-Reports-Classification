CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 42-year-old woman with peripheral visual loss, tunnel vision, some form of pressure behind the eye, seizure in 1988 after MVA, petit mal seizures, seizure free until four weeks ago with recurrence then. Depression, hypertension, and sleep apnea.
MEDICATIONS: Paxil, Dilantin, Benicar, and Vicodin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a well-formed 8.5 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasional LAMBDA waves are seen.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The patient becomes drowsy on multiple different occasions, sometimes with slow rolling eye movements and at other times with abrupt drop-out into stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Hyperventilation does not activate the tracing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study may be of use.  Consideration for the possibility of a disorder other than epilepsy is appropriate.
