CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old, right-handed male transferred from an outside hospital with a tonic-clonic seizure with a somewhat abnormal CSF, but normal MRI.  Evaluated for meningitis. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Acyclovir, and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is sharply contoured, almost rhythmic theta activity identified in the temporal regions left greater than right. This is accentuated by hyperventilation.  It has some of the stereotypic morphologies of a normal variant, but the frequency ranges from 3.6 to 7.1 and occurs in brief paroxysmal bursts.  The patient seems to be very drowsy, drifting off into stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This EEG must be considered outside the range of normal due to:
	The rhythmic temporal theta activity, which does not have the characteristic frequencies of a normal variant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While the activity described above is not specifically epileptiform in nature, it renders this EEG abnormal.  Additional recording may be important to determine if this activity improves over time, or may be associated with underlying epileptiform activity.  Of note, the patient was excessively drowsy and had difficulty completing hyperventilation.
