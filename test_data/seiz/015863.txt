CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 72-year-old woman found seizing at home and unresponsive.  Patient admitted on 12/17/06 and given Ativan in the ER.  Past history of diabetes, HTN, MI.  
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and includes generous beta activity and alpha frequency activity in the central regions in an otherwise slow delta pattern. The record is at times discontinuous, and spontaneous arousals produce an increase in theta frequency activity.  Tactile stimulation clearly produces reactivity with a more sustained mixed frequency pattern. 
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Replacement of normal background with an intermittently discontinuous pattern and generous beta activity in the central regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although this EEG is abnormal, there is reactivity to tactile stimulation.  This would imply a better prognosis.  This EEG might have been influenced by the sedation that she received.  Clinical correlation with neurologic examination and radiology would be helpful.
