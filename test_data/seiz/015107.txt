CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 61-year-old male referred from MCP with confusion, headache, and blurry vision with two seizures, a right occipital hemorrhage, and left hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS: Labetalol, Ativan, and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low to medium amplitude with generous background beta.  Superimposed upon this background, there is subtle focal slowing identified in the right central and posterior temporal regions.  Sleep is characterized by the appearance of vertex waves.  Arousals are characterized by an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity in the background.  At the close of the record, the patient seems to arouse spontaneously.  As he does so, a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm is identified.  The posterior dominant rhythm is 10 Hz on the left and disrupted on the right.  At the close of the record, when this patient arouses spontaneously, the left hemisphere is nearly intact and the right hemisphere continues to demonstrate intermittent focal slowing from the right posterior temporal and central regions. 
HR:  102 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with an area of focal delta, as well as disruption of the alpha rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests a dynamic pattern with the left hemisphere able to generate essentially a normal pattern by the close of the record.  This may be part of the natural history of an individual recovering from a hemorrhage and apparent seizures. No epileptiform features were seen.
