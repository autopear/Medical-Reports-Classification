CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 19-month-old male with febrile seizures – febrile seizure on 8/6/06 at 8:00 PM and another 8/7/06 at 8:00 AM – presented to the ER with status epilepticus, a temp of 103, treated with Ativan and Phenytoin.  History of febrile seizures in January and May 2006.  
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Tylenol, Ibuprofen.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is awake and drowsy and appears somewhat jittery. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, there is fast activity in the central regions and what appears to be vertex waves or vertex sharp waves.  The background EEG demonstrates an awake or drowsy record with movement and jitteriness.  The background EEG includes primarily theta frequency activity.  In addition, when the child is awake, there is a vertex sharp wave identified.  Using different montages, the activity seems to be maximum at Cz and/or Pz, sometimes more prominent at Pz than Cz, with fast activity picked up at Cz and C3 greater than C4.  Using a PFOT montage, the activity does seem to be more prominent in the left centroparietal region.  Features of drowsiness for this infant include an increase in hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  At the close of the record, the child seems to drift into stage II sleep, at which point more typical features of stage II sleep with spindle activity are identified.   Of note, however, there is more delta than one would expect and some of the spindle-like activity demonstrates shifting asymmetries.  
HR:  140 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Epileptiform activity identified at the midline with some predisposition towards the left hemisphere, which is unusual in terms of the presence at the vertex and the right midline parietal region.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the beta asymmetries and the focal features, correlation with imaging may be valuable.
