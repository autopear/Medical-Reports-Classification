CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old woman with epilepsy who presented with anemia, anomia, aphagia or amnesia, with right sided weakness and slurred speech, history of subdural hematoma on the right, now embolic CVA's on left 
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Dilantin, Levothyroxine, Actos, Zetia, Asa, Tylenol, Niacin, Metformin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 9 Hz alpha rhythm. There is shifting arrhythmic delta activity, sometimes a bit more so on the left than the right. There is a rare left temporal sharp wave. Lambda is observed. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. As the patient becomes drowsy, left posterior temporal slowing is more prominent. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Shifting slowing which today is a bit more prominent on the left. 
2. Single left temporal sharp wave. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. Prior EEGs demonstrated right focal slowing and left temporal sharp waves.
