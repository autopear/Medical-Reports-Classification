CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old, right-handed male admitted on July 3rd with multiple seizures at home with tongue biting and postictal confusion.  Seizures on the 4th in the hospital were tonic-clonic.  History of posttraumatic epilepsy since age 17.  
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a mainly asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes sleep.  Stage II sleep is well organized with vertex waves and spindles.  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but there is occasionally some posterior delta seen bilaterally in wakefulness.  Hyperventilation elicits generalized background slowing, but again also some posterior rhythmic theta and delta.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively asleep and does not activate the record.   
HR:  78 BPM, occasional APCs.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Posteriorly predominant HV response.
	Although there is limited wakefulness, some posteriorly predominant rhythmic slowing is intermixed with what otherwise would be a relatively normal background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  To further characterize this patientâ€™s epilepsy, a repeat study in the lab when the patient is a bit more consistently alert may be valuable.
