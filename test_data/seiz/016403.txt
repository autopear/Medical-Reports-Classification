CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 years old who presents with seizures after a fall. Past medical history is significant for left craniotomy now with subdural in the left occipital area. Patient has a history of a subdural hematoma.MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin,Tylenol,Ativan, Famotidine.INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at  bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. This is an awake record.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized and with slow activity in theta and on beta activity more on the left hemisphere. As the tracing continues on, the breach activity was seen in the left central area as well as multimorphological slow activity in the delta range was seen in the left hemisphere. Occasionally, the slow activity in the posterior region can be recognized. Diffuse beta activity was seen throughout the tracing. No sleeping stages were achieved in this tracing.HR:	84 bpmIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in wakefulness due to:1. Disorganized background.2. Asymmetric findings with slow activity in delta range in the left hemisphere.3. Breach activity on the left.4. Diffuse beta activity .CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal abnormal findings on the left hemisphere is consistent with history of subdural hematoma well as with a history of left craniotomy in this patient. The diffuse amount of beta activity may be due to medication such as Ativan use. No epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing. If seizure is a clinical concern,a repeat EEG may be helpful.
