CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of alcohol-induced seizures.  Patient presents with a fall and hip fracture.  History of old right CVA, seizures, and alcohol abuse.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Phenobarbital, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric with diffuse beta activity.  There is a 9 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage beta activity.  There is shifting arrhythmic delta activity, which increased during hyperventilation and persisted into the post-hyperventilation period.  In drowsiness, occasional left temporal sharp waves were observed.  Sleeping is characterized by vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.  Photic stimulation failed to activate the record and the patient continued to sleep during photic.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive diffuse beta activity.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
Occasional left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The shifting arrhythmic delta activity with left temporal sharp activity may be partially responsible for the mechanism of epilepsy in this patient.  The excessive beta activity may be due to either medications such as benzodiazepines (Ativan) or chronic alcohol use.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG in the future may be helpful for follow-up.
