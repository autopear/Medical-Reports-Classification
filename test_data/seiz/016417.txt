CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year-old male patient who was found down on the floor with 
slurred speech, unable to get up. CT of the brain found him to have left intracerebral 
hemorrhage with a vent trach. The patient had seizure in emergency department. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation were not performed. This is awake and drowsy record. The patient is not 
intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG included interhemispheric 
symmetry with a little bit of slower frequency on the left side and a higher amplitude on 
the right side. The right side hemisphere demonstrated alpha 7 to 8 hertz per second. 
The left side has disrupted pattern with decreased faster activity. Drowsiness is 
characterized as eye rolling movement and increasing theta and increasing beta, slower 
on the right side. No spikes were observed. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background with slowing on the left side. 
2. Disrupted alpha rhythm slowing 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptic feature was observed. Left focal slowing may 
be secondary to the underlying structure abnormality. Absence of epileptiform feature 
does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
