CLINICAL HISTORY: 50-year-old woman who presented in late December with a 
pontine hemorrhage. The patient continues to have unreactive pupils, but some 
movement. Previously almost a form of alpha coma. 
MEDICATIONS: Nexium, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has a 
tracheostomy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous. It includes 
diffuse, rhythmic beta frequency activity of 6 to 7 Hz. There are also bursts of rhythmic 
frontal delta. The patient's eyes are described as closed. There is no attempt to open 
the patient's eyes as was done in the previous EEG, but eye bobbing or eye movement 
is not apparent. There is intermittent frontal delta. Some of this is higher amplitude in 
the right frontal region in comparison to the left. Looking at the eye monitor, there is 
likely, movement of the eyes, but again it is not tested. Stimulation of the patient does 
not activate the record and the tactile stimulation includes stimulation of the patient's 
cranium. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a pattern of theta and bursts of frontal delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous records, there is no 
improvement in the background. There is no evidence of awaking or alerting observed 
in this 20 minute EEG. In addition, the absence of reactivity to external stimuli and 
variability over a 20 minute period is discouraging.
