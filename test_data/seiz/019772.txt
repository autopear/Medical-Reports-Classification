CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 63-year-old male with a seizure, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and abnormal CT now with excessive drowsiness.  
MEDICATIONS: Zyprexa, Dilantin, and antibiotics.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in a relatively somnolent patient. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta frequency pattern of 6 to 7 Hz.  When not stimulated, the patient drifts off to sleep with an increase in beta activity followed by spindles and occasional vertex waves.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG primarily in drowsiness due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and can be seen in a diffuse disorder of cerebral function including a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were seen.
