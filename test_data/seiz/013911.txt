HISTORY: 30 year old female with a history of minor head trauma after age 8. Patient stopped 
Dilantin in 2000. She reports a handful of spells in the following years characterized by deep 
staring but mother described the seizures as tonic clonic with generalized motor activity. Alcohol 
and cocaine use during pregnancy 
MEDICATION: Tylenol #3, Motrin, Serax, others. 
ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat 
disorganized. There is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with excess background theta. 
There are also bursts of arrhythmic, relatively symmetric frontal delta. This EEG demonstrates a 
handful of sharp waves from the right hemisphere, particularly the right frontocentral. Some have 
a phase reversal in the right mid to anterior temporal region and a spike and wave complex. 
There are rare left temporal sharp waves. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in 
stage TI sleep and there are intermittent vertex waves and beta spindles noted. 
HR: 72BPM 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background disorganization 
2. Intermittent discreet sharp waves which seem to be primarily in the right with variability 
but are deeper from the right frontocentral and/or temporal region 
CLINICAL This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. 
In the context of a history of eclampsia/pre-eclampsia, correlation with imaging is important. In 
addition, given the history of childhood epilepsy, correlation with imaging to exclude an 
abnormality in brain development is important.
