CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year-old who fell and subsequently had a seizure in the 
emergency room. He was found to have a right subdural hematoma requiring right 
craniotomy. History of bipolar disease, pacemaker, heart failure, COPD, hypertension. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Cefazolin, Gentamicin, Vecuronium, Morphine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was described as 
somewhat restless. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is diffusely slow and low voltage. 
There is a breach rhythm identified at C4 with single channel artifact in the region of the 
craniectomy. There is clear variability in the record. Some portions are much richer in 
beta frequency activity and others are richer in delta. The patient is agitated and there 
is an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity and the patient tries to get up. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a slow pattern alternating with primarily 
a beta and theta frequency pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The beta 
asymmetry with accentuation of beta in the region of the craniectomy as anticipated 
following the neurosurgical procedure described above. There does appear to be some 
additional focal delta in that quadrant but there are some limitations with scalp electrode 
placement.
