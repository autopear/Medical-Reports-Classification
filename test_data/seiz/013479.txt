CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 82-year-old male admitted after a fall with loss of consciousness as well as T5 and T6 fracture with a left hemiparesis.  This is a follow-up study. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, antibiotics, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and ventilator dependent during the record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric, continuous, and diffusely slow, with theta and delta activity.  There is also a great deal of muscle artifact.  The patient is constantly opening his eyes while the technician is trying to keep them closed.  A posterior dominant alpha rhythm of approximately 10 Hz is transiently seen.  Increased beta activity is also seen, as well as occasional bursts of delta activity. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Disorganized and diffusely slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The increased beta activity may be due to medications such as Ativan use.  In comparison to this patientâ€™s previous EEG of February 6, 2004, this tracing is markedly improved. The previous PLEDS are no longer seen.  No clinical seizures were recorded during this tracing.
