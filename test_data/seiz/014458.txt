MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During wakefulness there is organization of a posterior dominant alpha rhythm. At times it is slower at 8 Hz, but does reach normal limits at 9 Hz.  There is some higher amplitude seen in the right hemisphere,  which is a normal variant. During drowsiness delta activity is seen.  As the patient enters hyperventilation, there is activation of the record with slowing.  As it continues a right anterior temporal delta activity is seen.   This continues after hyperventilation especially in F2 through F8, very discrete sharp waves are also seen in this region. Photic stimulation does cause driving of the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Right anterior delta activity, which continues after hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is very discrete epileptiform activity seen, along with these there is a focus of slow activity seen in the right anterior temporal region that is
seen extensively during hyperventilation. Previous EEG shows similar findings.
