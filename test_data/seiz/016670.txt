DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized with a 6 to 7 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness, increasing in drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta activity as well as shifting, arrhythmic delta activity. 
HR:  102 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
FIRDA.
