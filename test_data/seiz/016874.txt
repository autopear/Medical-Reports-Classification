CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old gentleman with swelling of the lower extremities, acute renal failure
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lasix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta frequency pattern of 6 to 7 Hz with smaller amounts of 8 to 9 Hz. A posterior dominant rhythm, when identifiable, is low voltage and approximately 7 Hz.  In wakefulness, there are occasional shifting asymmetries, particularly in the central and temporal regions with shifting delta. As the patient becomes slightly drowsy, there are bursts of frontally predominant, slightly irregular delta.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Occasional frontally predominant irregular delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing in the laboratory, capturing deeper stages of sleep as well as performing hyperventilation and photic stimulation would be useful.
