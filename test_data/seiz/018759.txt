CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 58-year-old, right-handed male with seizures for the past five years, last tonic-clonic six months ago. Adult onset epilepsy. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Phenobarb. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 to 8 Hz, 30 V.  There is a small amount of excess background theta activity identified in wakefulness.  In the initial portions of the record, there is rare, left temporal focal slowing with occasional sharply contoured theta/delta.  
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and seems to accentuate the focal slowing.  Drowsiness is associated with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and a more diffuse distribution of the beta frequency activity.  The left temporal focal slowing does not becomes more prominent.  
Photic stimulation elicits brief, symmetric driving at intermediate and faster flash frequencies. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
Excess background theta and mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter.  Medications may play a role in the pattern described above.  The sharply contoured focal slowing from the left temporal region carries an intermediate correlation with a structural or functional abnormality in that region.  To further characterize this patientâ€™s epilepsy, a follow-up study with deeper stages of sleep could be helpful.
