CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old male with epilepsy following gunshot wound to head 10 
years ago. 1-3 seizures per month. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has a left-sided skull defect. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a relatively low voltage 
pattern with an alpha rhythm of 9 Hz, 20-30 microvolt's. Prominent eye movement artifact is 
observed. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in beta. 
In addition to the prominent eye artifact, there is also some asymmetric eye artifact as might be 
observed following craniotomy or cranial defect. By the close of hyperventilation the left 
hemisphere demonstrates lower voltage beta compared to the right. Following this, as the 
patient becomes drowsy there is focal slowing more prominent in the left frontocentral region 
compared to the right. Photic stimulation was performed while the individual is awake, again 
with this asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left. During the Photic 
stimulation, there is a great deal of eye artifact but there is a suggestion of a left frontocentral 
sharp wave. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. An asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency on the left relative to the right. 
2. Asymmetric eye movement artifacts which should be correlated with cranial changes and 
eye movement. 
3. Suspicious underlying left frontocentral sharp waves, confounded by the presence of 
frequent eye movements. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the frequent eye movement artifacts, a repeat tracing in 
sleep may be considered to completely evaluate for left frontocentral sharp waves.
