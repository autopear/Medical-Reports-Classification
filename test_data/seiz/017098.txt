CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 65-year-old gentleman with anoxic injury, cervical spine injury, and intermittent eye blinking or oral twitching. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Valium, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as comatose, with occasional eye bobbing.  It is not possible to review the video from this study due to technical problems. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is intubated in the ICU with a halo.  His eyes are open.  He no longer has continuous eye blinking in this section of the record.  The background EEG is low voltage.  There is a slow, 1 to 3 Hz frontally predominant poly spike and slow wave complex.  This has an after going slow wave, which can last up to a second.  There is some subtle frequency evolution but not characteristic ictal evolution.  There are also some occasional bursts of fast activity identified from this frontal activity.  Stimulation of the patient seems to produce a suppression of the activity. 
Stimulation of the patient on later occasions does not produce any significant change in the background.
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with relatively low voltage theta and delta.
Low, frontally predominant poly spike and slow wave activity, as well as brief bursts of fast activity with some frequency variability.
Minimal reactivity and variability.
 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features may be seen following anoxic encephalopathy or late in the course of status epilepticus.  Compared to previous studies, the epileptiform activity is less vigorous and does not evolve as quickly.
