CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 10.3-year-old female with Crouzonâ€™s syndrome, developmental delay, hydrocephalus, multiple shunt revisions with new onset seizures: left tonic-clonic activity, left head and eye deviation, treated with Ativan 3/21/04.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is awake and moving almost continuously. She has bilateral craniotomy or ventriculostomy sites. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is not adequately organized for a child of this age.  There is generous beta activity identified bilaterally from the frontocentral regions.  There is no well defined posterior dominant rhythm, although there is intermittent high amplitude 4 to 5 Hz activity seen from the occipital regions.  In addition to the beta and the occipital high amplitude theta/delta, the overall background is one of theta.  There are occasional shifting asymmetries.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in the background beta.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
Absence of the appropriate developmental milestones.
High amplitude occipital 3 to 5 Hz activity.
Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  To put this record in the appropriate clinical context, correlation with imaging may be helpful.
