CLINICAL HISTORY:  Twenty-nine-year-old  woman with bipolar disease, colitis, myopathy, back pain and sudden bilateral weakness.
	MEDICATIONS: 	Lamictal, Ativan, Dilantin, ciprofloxacin, Decadron.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10 and 20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG in wakefulness is abnormal with excess background theta and a posterior dominant rhythm typically in the range of 6-7 hertz, 50-70 microvolts. Intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta or generalized mixed 3-5 hertz activity are observed. Hyperventilation performed early on in the record clearly accentuating rhythmic high amplitude mixed theta and delta. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. Spindles are identified in stage 2 sleep. Multiple arousals in and out of stage 2 sleep are observed.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient transitions to
and from stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.
HR: 56 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. What is likely hypersomnolence as well as possibly an underlying disruption of sleep with epochs transitioning between stage 2 sleep and wakefulness.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	Careful clinical consideration is important to determine if this patient's medications or clinical
events could produce this degree of background slowing. No epileptiform features are observed.
