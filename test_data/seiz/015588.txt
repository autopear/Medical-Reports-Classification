	CLINICAL HISTORY:   66 year-old right-handed male with history of childhood epilepsy, seizure-free  since his teens. Previously on Dilantin and phenobarbital, transitioned to Dilantin monotherapy with a confusional spell on 09/14/2008. The patient also has COPD and cerebral atrophy. 
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Plavix, Simvasta.tin, Spironolaction, Famotidine, lsosorbide, Insulin, ASA, Oxycodone, Lovenox, Senokote, Lantus, Keppra, Methylprednisolone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient transitions frequently between wakefulness and drowsiness. The overall background is poorly organized. In sleep, there is a high amplitude frontally predominant spike and wave complex, but there is only 1 spike. Estimated frequency in sleep would be 2.5 hertz. Following the spike and
wave complex, the patient has a slow and disorganized background, but there are some
	posts and spindles. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. HR: 	98 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Background slowing and disorganization.
	2. 	A frontally predominant  symmetric  pike
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized background  and disorganization may reflect this patient's current adult, geriatric pathology with COPD and evidence of either dementia or delirium. The spike and wave complex is most supportive of an inherited mechanism for epilepsy. Given the history and the presence of epileptiform activity, these findings may be clinically important.
