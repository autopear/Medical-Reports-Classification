CLINICAL HISTORY:   30-year-old right handed woman with a history of childhood epilepsy status post brain surgery for abscess versus tumor with recent epilepsia partialis continua last week. Currently 27 weeks pregnant.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is somewhat drowsy throughout the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall background in apparent wakefulness is relatively slow. From the left hemisphere, there is occasional 7-8 hertz activity and a glimpse of an alpha rhythm. The right hemisphere demonstrates  essentially continuous arrhythmia delta activity. There are a handful of sharp waves observed in the right frontocentral region. The right hemisphere includes intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity. The sharp waves out of the right demonstrate  variable maximum including some at C4-P4 and others a little bit more right frontal. Occasional bursts of FIRDA are observed. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements  and an increase in background  slowing. Testing is not performed to assure maximal wakefulness however, in the later portions of the record, the patient is more clearly awake with what remains to be a somewhat slow record on the left.
	HR:	90 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal, but improved EEG due to:
	1. 	Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere with arrhythmic delta.
	2. 	Occasional but no longer continuous sharp waves in the right hemisphere.
	3. 	Background slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural functional abnormality  on the right, congruent with imaging. The background slowing observed from the left may be part of a postictal pattern or due to the longstanding use of hypnotic medications in this individual with refractory seizures.
