CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old, left-handed male with paroxysmal spells for three years â€“ considered seizures.  History of anxiety in the past and/or alcohol consumption. Seizures associated with substance abuse in 2002, 2003, and 2004. 
I
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third normal EEG for this individual.  No epileptiform features were seen in the 2004 and 2003 EEGs.
