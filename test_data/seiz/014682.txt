CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old male with epilepsy, alcohol abuse, stroke, and hypertension who presented to Episcopal with recurrent seizures requiring Ativan and Dilantin. 
MEDICATIONS: 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record in a patient who is somewhat uncooperative. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates wakefulness and drowsiness.  There are brief portions of the record when the patient has his eyes opened with a low voltage beta frequency pattern.  Other portions of the record demonstrate a pattern rich in alpha and theta frequency activity, with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 8 Hz.  There is some head rocking artifact as the study continues. 
 
HR:  __ BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild slowing of the background rhythm to 8 Hz.
Excess background beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this record.  Comparison with this patientâ€™s previous EEGs would be helpful in terms of the search for epileptiform activity.  The mild background slowing may be due to a postictal state or medication effect.  The excess beta is likely due to the benzodiazepine exposure.
