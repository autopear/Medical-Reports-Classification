CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old male in pentobarb coma. 
MEDICATIONS: Pentobarb, Dilantin, Fentanyl, Propofol, Versed, Mannitol, Seena 
INTRODUCTION: Continous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. In this section of the record, the patient's medications and medication manipulation are not listed. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a suppressed pattern. Reviewing the data at very low sensitivities, there is a bit of theta in the left frontal region. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Suppressed background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are a bit more prominent than one might expect in pentobarb coma, but by clinical report, it has been difficult to manage this patient without a completely suppressed pattern due to ongoing ICP issues.
