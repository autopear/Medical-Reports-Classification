CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old man with paranoid schizophrenia, childhood epilepsy and recent fall with scalp hematoma. CAT scan showing atrophy and big ventricles. 
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Famotidine, Ancef, Tegretol, Lovenox, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation performed. This was an awake study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: A disorganized slow posterior rhythm is seen at 6 Hz at 35 microvolt's. During wakefulness, an interhemispheric asymmetry is seen with a slower background on the right hemisphere which is more attenuated and of a lower voltage. Rare independent sharp waves are seen in both the left and right mid temporal regions. T5 phase reversals are also seen. A few triphasic waves are also seen within the record. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Moderately abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Interhemispheric asymmetry with slower attenuated rhythm on the right hemisphere. 
2. Overall slowing of the background. 
3. Rare independent sharp waves in the mid temporal regions both of theright and left hemisphere. 
4. A few triphasic waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The rare independent sharp waves are consistent with a focus of epilepsy, however no seizure activity was recorded. The decrease amplitude in the right hemisphere could be consistent with the history of a scalp hematoma. The overall slowing of the background and triphasic waves are consistent with an encephalopathy, acute versus chronic.
