REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This patient is a 46-year-old female brought in for first episode of seizure described as shaking all over, tongue biting, history of left-sided AVM with clips.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during lethargy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  Activities during the procedure were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen almost continuously and frequently at T5 with a large field that spread over the left hemisphere. 
Focal slowing seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal at T5 and frequency at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  The posterior temporal sharp waves at T5 appear to start and stop but at times appear to evolve in frequency and increase in amplitude and then suddenly stop and start again.  There appears to be no clinical correlation to this burst that may last for minutes but are most consistent with electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to recurring electrographic left posterior temporal seizures, in addition to left posterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with the known AVM.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to activity and may be due at least in part due to medication affect.  These findings were reported to the primary team as soon as the EEG was read at 7:00 p.m. on 10/22/2012.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old female with left posterior temporal AVM and clips brought in with first episode of seizure described as shaking all over with tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Chlorhexidine and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead  EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while confused, unresponsive, and lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 5-7 Hz and there is some frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures were not performed. 
Abnormal discharges:
Frequent T5 sharp waves seen throughout the recording.  At times the sharp waves would suddenly become rhythmic and continue for about 2-3 minutes and then stop.  They did not clearly evolve, but became extremely arrhythmic throughout this time.  
Focal slowing seen at T5 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  
Moderate diffuse slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording. 
Seizures:  As above mentioned there is bursts of T5 sharp waves that did not clearly evolve, but would start and stop suddenly, at times for minutes with no clinical correlate.  These are concerning for possible electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterior temporal sharp waves and monomorphic discharges concerning for electrographic seizures, in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left posterior temporal region.  Note:  The bursts of rhythmic sharp waves were concerning for electrographic seizures, as they had no clinical correlate.  In addition, there is evidence of moderate diffuse slowing, which may due at least in part to medication effect.  These findings were reported to the primary team who decided to treat the patient and will place the patient on long term monitoring.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old woman with first episode of seizures and a known left occipital AVM.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy and confusion.  No activating procedures were performed.   Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and nurses' notes as well as patient alarms were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the last 8 hours of the recording, there was multiple electrode artifact as they were detached.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record remains without background which has a very seldom posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7-8 Hz.  There are no activating procedures and there is some frontal central beta seen.  Overall, however, is mainly diffusely slow and a theta 5-7 Hz frequency.  Some sleep architecture can be seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen continuously at T5 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz in a monomorphic fashion consistent with periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).  
Focal slow waves are seen over the left hemisphere, maximal at T5 continuously throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz is seen throughout the recording continuously.
SEIZURES:  The patient had multiple electrographic seizures that would appear to arise from the left hemisphere, maximally over the posterior temporal region at T5 intervals and a delta rhythmic discharge that increases in frequency and amplitude and becomes better formed until it suddenly stops.  This first seizure occurred at 10:43:18 a.m. and ended at 10:45 a.m. A second similar seizure occurred at 4:21:57 p.m. and ended at 4:25:51 p.m. and the last seizure occurred around 10:50 p.m.  At that point, multiple electrodes had been lost which made it difficult to evaluate the origin of the seizure but appeared to be similar to the other ones.  Please note that during none of these seizures there appeared to be a clinical correlate.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to left hemispheric seizures arising possibly from the left posterior temporal region in addition to left posterior temporal periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges and focal slow waves in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with multiple seizures arising from the left hemisphere, likely posterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of acute structural  in the left posterior temporal region.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  These findings were continuously reported to the primary team to make adjustments in treatment based on the seizures.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 46-year-old woman, admitted with increasing seizure frequency.  Her seizures are felt to be secondary to AVM.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Seizure detection software was activated.  Nursing notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is significant right to left interhemispheric asymmetry, with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.  During maximal wakefulness, the background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta and delta without expected posterior dominant rhythm or anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with additional polymorphic delta over the right temporal region.  No posterior dominant rhythm or anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is observed over the left hemisphere.  During sleep, sleep spindle-like complexes are captured.  Continuous moderate amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves are captured over the left posterior temporal region.  Intermittently throughout the recording, these discharges occur rhythmically at approximately 1 to 2 Hz and correspond to periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.  Approximately 8 electrographic seizures are captured.  They start with increasing frequency epileptiform discharges, and rapidly evolve into rhythmic theta and later alpha, most prominent over the left posterior quadrant.  As seizure progresses, these discharges spread throughout the left hemisphere and decrease in frequency to about 3.5 Hz delta range.  These seizures last approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  There is no clinical correlate that is evident from the video review.  From approximately 4 p.m. until approximately 5:30 p.m., several leads are intermittently disconnected.  This limits interpretation of the EEG during that time period.
FINDINGS:  
Focal left hemispheric slowing.
Frequent left posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges that intermittently organize into 1 to 2 Hz PLEDS.  
Approximately 8 electrographic seizures that start over the left posterior quadrant and spread throughout the left hemisphere.  These seizures do not have a clear clinical correlate.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous audio-video EEG due to:
Moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
Focal left hemispheric slowing.
Frequent left posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges that are frequently periodic.
Approximately 8 electrographic seizures lasting 3 to 4 minutes with onset over the left posterior quadrant.   
Diffuse slowing indicates nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that in this case could partially be related to the medication effect.  Focal left hemispheric slowing and epileptiform discharges indicate structural pathology over that region that has high epileptogenic potential.  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left posterior quadrant.  When compared to the EEG from the prior 24 hours, there has been no significant change in the degree of the background slowing or frequency of seizures or epileptiform discharges.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  58-year-old man with bifrontal bur holes and evacuation of subdural hematomas with change in mental status, with the wife noting that he is lip smacking and staring but never returned to baseline.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software as well as patient notes and nurse's notes and patient alarms were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the recording appears to be mainly in the delta frequencies with some intermittent faster frequencies showing up periodically.  There are some stage changes noted.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen continuously at T5/P3 with a periodicity that ranges from 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz, at times becoming slightly less organized.  These are consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  Although there were about 2-3 rhythmic runs of the PLEDs, there were 2 electrographic seizures.  One occurred at 4:15 p.m. lasting for a minute and a half.  The 2nd one occurred at 9:43 p.m.  Both of them did not appear to have any clear clinical correlate.  They were comprised of rhythmic P3-4/T5 sharp waves, evolving in frequency and amplitude and then suddenly stopping.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterior temporal and parietal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) and electrographic seizures in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals left posterior temporal and parietal seizures as well as a focus of irritability and cerebral dysfunction in that region.  This is likely related to the known lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral  dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.
	


CLINICAL HISTORY:  33 year old female with history of severe mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term monitoring  EEG was performed at bedside  using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike and wave detection software was performed for seizure detection, as well as patient alarm for detection of events.  Also the nurses reported events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm nor frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
As seen before, focal sharp waves in multiple places, including F4, T3, P3, and T5, as well as frontal polyspikes seen throughout the recording.  
Generalized slow waves 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV were seen throughout the recording. 
SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording there is about 15 seizures seen throughout the recording where the patient suddenly lifts her arms tonically and her face also opens in a tonic fashion.  This episode lasts 15-20 seconds and then stops.  There appears to be a sudden attenuation diffusely throughout the recording.  There seems to be a paroxysm of fast that cannot be localized to one specific region, followed by tonic muscle artifact throughout the recording and diffuse slowing at the end of the seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Multiple tonic seizures of generalized onset. 
Multifocal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of generalized epilepsy with multiple seizures of unclear onset, as well as multiple focus of possible seizures of brain irritability and seizure onset.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology and may be due to the patient's overall cognitive deficits or disease. These findings were reported to the primary team.

Focal sharp waves were seen in multiple places including F8/T2, F7/T3, T5, C4, and P3.  In addition to this, there are bursts of polyspike and wave at 2 Hz seen intermittently throughout the recording on both days.  There is no clinical correlation to these polyspike and wave discharges.
At times there were, during the first 24 hours more frequently than the last 24, discharges of fast beta frequency discharges with an abrupt ending seen at T5/P3 and at times at P4/T6 with no clear correlate.  They would last for about 10 to 15 seconds and then stop. 
Seizures:  The patient would develop sudden onset of bilateral arm raising and mouth opening for about 10 to 15 seconds and then stop.  During this, the EEG would suddenly attenuate and there would be a fast beta pattern seen diffusely followed by muscle artifact.  During this recording, the patient had only 3 of these in the past 2 days.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multifocal spikes, diffuse slowing, some electrographic seizures, and some clinical seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  In addition, there is evidence of multiple focal irritability and diffuse seizures consistent with generalized symptomatic epilepsy.  Please note that this recording has markedly improved since the beginning and the clinical seizures have almost subsided and only 3 were seen in the past 48 hours.  These findings were reported to the primary team.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  33 year old female with a history of severe MR, cerebral palsy, and seizures, with multiple seizures today.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Ativan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrent seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake and asleep.  The record was reviewed using continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and patient noted events, as well as review of the tracings.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves were seen in multiple places including F4, T3, P3, and T5 intermittently.  In addition, there were rounds of frontal  polyspikes that at times were more than left and right predominant.
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts seen throughout the recording. 
SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording there were 9 tonic seizures noted where the patient suddenly lifted her left and right arms tonically followed by her face opening also in a tonic fashion.  These last for about 15 to 20 seconds and then stop.  In the EEG there appears to be a sudden attenuation seen diffusely throughout the recording consistent with paroxysmal fasts that cannot be localized to one specific region followed by tonic muscle artifact seen throughout the recording and followed by diffuse slowing at the end of the seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
multiple tonic seizures of generalized unclear onset. 
multifocal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy with multiple seizures of unclear onset as well as multiple focus for origination of seizures.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology and may be due to the patient's overall cognitive disease.


CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old woman with recurrent complex partial status. 
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Phenobarbital, Diovan, Zocor, ISOSORBIDE, HCTZ, Levothyroxine, Plavix, ASA, Darvoct, Protonix, Lovenox, Metoprolol, Zosyn, Thiamine 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was preformed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. During the course of the record, the patient's phenobarbital reaches 50. She has occasional clinical seizures twitching In her right hand and eye blinking. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG varies from a very low voltage suppressed pattern to 1 with a bit of theta and then a sharp wave in the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread. The activity at this point seems to start at T1 with a complex field of spread and it is primarily in the left hemisphere. As the recording continues including into the early morning hours on the 5th, there is some intermittent asymmetric discontinuity, but in fact as the phenobarbital level, moves toward 50, there is a bit more of a rhythmic background. 
An electrographic seizure occurs at 5:36 a.m. The video camera is on the left of the patient and the patient's left arm jerks, but the other side cannot be identified. The activity begins at 53602 and must be localized to the left hemisphere. The activity continues and the patient's right face can seen to be jerking at 5:37. A clinician is at the bedside and walks away during the event, but then returns and provides oral hygiene during the seizure. 
Following the seizure, the sharp waves are noted primary in the left hemisphere with rhythmic theta and some sharp waves at F8. Additional seizures are picked up by the seizure spike detector. At 7:42, include a burst of sharp waves at 12:46 on the afternoon of the 4th. A more clear seizure at 12:47, again similar to the event described initially although the patient is under the covers and it is not possible to see that she is twitching, 1:47, 2:15, 3:18, p.m. 3:55 which does not particularly build up until 4:20, 4:54, 5:42, 6:26 p.m. More significant, repetitive seizures are noted occurring 1-2 times per hour out of the left on the evening of the 4th and this pattern persists into the early morning hours on the 5th. By the morning of the 5th, however, the seizure pattern seems to have stopped. There is intermittent seizures, but no more sustained discharges. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old female with recurrent complex partial status. 
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Levothyroxine, Propofol, Simvastatin, ISOSORBIDE, 
Potassium, Plavix, ASA, Protonix, Lovenox, Thiamine, Diovan, Zocor, Metoprolol 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During this section of the record, the patient 
received levetiracetam and her propofol dose was titrated up. 
Seven electrographic seizures are noted. These are typically 2 minutes in duration and 
began with repetitive sharp activity in the left hemisphere, maximum in the temporal 
region. The activity can be frontotemporal with characteristic frequency evolution. 
Characteristics of the seizure Include eye blinking, drooling, and some facial twitching. 
The interictal record is continuous. The patient is no longer in burst suppression. There 
are some triangular frontal sharp waves, right more so than the left. 
In addition, interictal sharp activity is noted primarily with left anterior temporal sharp 
waves, although there are epileptiform discharges on the right. 
HR: 80 to 100 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Interval impression: The presence of only 7 complex partial seizures in 
a 24-hour epoch for this Individual represents an improvement. 


CLINICAL HISTORY; 91 year old with medical history of dementia, hypertension, 
and generalized compulsive seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, ASA, Metformin, Keppra. 
REASON FOR STUDY: Rule out seizures. 
INTRODUCTION' Digital video EEG was perform at bedside using 10-20 
system of electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal electrodes and 
EKG electrodes. Patient was obtunded during recording. No activating procedures 
were performed. 
..DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The r cord opens to a diffusely slow asymmetric 
background. The left hemisphere is composed of theta frequencies with intermixed 
beta frequencies mainly seen in the frontal regions but some of them can be seen more 
posteriorly. The amplitude of these on the left hemisphere is 20 to 50 
microvolts. The right hemisphere is of delta frequencies with low amplitude 
about 20 to 30 microvolts and seen No sleep architecture or normal 
posterior dominant rhythm is seen. No activating procedures were performed. While 
the patient is stimulated, there is mild changing the frequencies of the recording. 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
1. Right hemispheric delta slowing and attenuation. 
2. Generalized slow waves. 
SEIZURES: There are 6 seizures seen. the majority due not have a clear onset, but 
appear to be emanating from the right hemisphere. Two of them appear to develop with 
mid temporal (T4) beta that evolves In frequency and amplitude over the right 
hemisphere. As it continues to evolve, the left hemisphere picks up muscle artifact 
which continues to evolve and-contaminate the whole EEG. After a minute or so, the 
muscle artifact decreases and an evolving charge over the right hemisphere maximal 
in the frontotemporal region can be seen which suddenly stops. After the seizure ends, 
there is a well-defined right hemispheric slowing that appears to be post ictal. The 
seizures last an average duration about 2 minutes.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old man known to Neuro with a  previous history of mitochondrial disease, MELAS, refractory epilepsy, cardiomyopathy, recurrent seizures characterized by flexion of the arm, elevation of the right arm and stiffening.  Also, a history of status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Topamax, Clonazepam, Lisinopril, Vimpat, Dilantin, Norvasc, Metoprolol
REASON FOR EGG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while asleep mainly.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens with the patient in sleep, mainly in Stage II with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta seen.  In between the recording the patient develops paroxysm bursts of fast activity which appears to be diffusely seen and mixed with myogenic artifact. It is difficult to piece out the electric serial activity from the myogenic artifact, but clearly occurs paroxysmally in bursts lasting up to 20 to 21 seconds.  During this event there is no clear changes that can be seen on the EEG and in the latter halves of the bursts there appears to be some rhythmic theta-like activity.  Frontal theta predominant consistent with some frontal slowing.  Otherwise, the patient is recorded mainly in sleep.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Bursts of polyspike generalized discharges lasting for a second. 
Generalized slowing, absence of normal EEG architecture even during wakefulness.   
SEIZURES:  
The above described episodes of generalized polyspike and fast followed intermixed with myogenic artifact and followed by some frontal theta consistent with generalized seizures.  However, clinically there are no clear behavioral changes seen on the video.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Generalized seizures.  
Polyspike discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of generalized epilepsy with multiple seizures seen during the recording.  No normal awake activity was seen, but mainly the patient was recorded with intermittent sleep.  It is suggested to have continued recording of this individual as the seizures are treated]


CLINICAL HISTORY:   43  year old woman with epilepsy since age 32 with 4 seizures per month.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient reported her last seizure more than a week prior to admission, but was somewhat distressed upon admission and difficult to console.  Continuous seizure and spike detection software was utilized.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  April 23 to April 24, 2012:   Wakefulness demonstrates a well organized background.  There is some problems overnight with FP1 electrode.  On rare occasions there is some subtle left temporal theta.  This is seen in wakefulness and on rare occasions in sleep.  Using an average reference there is some discreet, rare left temporal sharp waves at F7 in sleep.  The theta described on the left is quite infrequent and the vast majority of the record demonstrates normal wakefulness through stage II sleep. 
April 24 through April 25, 2012:  During this section of the record the patient experienced no clinical seizures.  This section of the record is characterized by a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness includes rhythmic background slowing with vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles.  The patient is asleep in the afternoon and awake a fair amount during the day.  Unfortunately there is a fair amount of electrode artifact in many sections of the record.  There is a paucity of focal or 
epileptiform activity and in fact in comparison to previous EEGs for this patient, the overall EEG is well organized.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was utilized with seizure and spike detection.  Unfortunately, the patient’s prosthetic hair was a serious impediment interfering with the electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient had a seizure at 12:34 on April 26, which was completely unlocalized by the EEG, in part due to artifact and then subsequently by the patient’s removal of the EEG electrodes during the seizures. 
This seizure and its postictal changes were at least 4 minutes in duration.  The patient was eating.  She stopped eating, she was looking away from the camera.  She had automatisms with her left foot and then she looked away from the camera.  For many minutes, either during or after the seizure, she had automatisms of the hands and face with hand washing movements.  She was able to push the tray back from the bed.  She seemed like she was about to fall of the bed, but actually was able to get herself back on the bed. Random wakefulness and sleep in the hours following, including in sleep, there were right temporal sharp waves noted.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted in stage II sleep. 
In the additional recording on the morning of April 27, there were a handful of sharp waves on the left, but more significant sharp waves on the right. The technologist continued to work with the patient, including wrapping the scalp, but with limited success in terms of maintaining the quality of the EEG recording.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was utilized using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with seizure and spike detection.  The patient had no seizures.  None were identified by the computerized seizure and spike detector.  She has braids and it is a challenge to keep her electrodes in place.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex phase, K-complexes, and spindles. The automated seizure detectors identify only artifacts.   Particularly in the early morning hours, there is significant electrode problems.   
HR:    60 bpm  
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  No clinical seizures were reported.  The patient has extensive braids.  Her head was wrapped in an attempt to try and preserve the electrode integrity.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There are sections where the electrode integrity is pretty good.  Unfortunately, there are also other sections where it is not, particularly at C3.   
Although there are no clinical seizures noted, there is a prominent burst of rhythmic delta from the right temporal region with a sharp wave at 12:29.  This did not appear to have triggered the seizure and spike detector.  The patient is lying on her side.  She moves about afterward.  Although this is highly suspicious for a subclinical seizure, seizure onset and offset is difficult to tell and there are other electrode problems.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  The patient spent most of the day in bed. Unfortunately, every time the patient moves around, it triggers the seizure and spike detector, which makes it very difficult to rely on the seizure and spike detector for epileptiform seizures.   
HR:    60 to 80 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring recording was remarkable for:
Interictal epileptiform activity which included sharp waves, primarily seen on the right. 
One clear complex partial seizure which was not adequately localized by scalp and part due to technical difficulties.
Question subclinical seizure at midday on the 27th, again with some technical issues due to electrode issues.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a focal mechanism for epilepsy based on the interictal spikes and the seizure semiology on the video, but the data obtained is not adequate for a presurgical localization.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old gentleman with epilepsy since the 1980s, temporal lobe epilepsy. Wife reports that he has been noncompliant with medications recently.  Past history of alcohol dependence, but none for the last 3 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The patient is postictal, experiences a seizure during the EEG and is uncooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is postictal and the EEG is diffusely slow with a lower voltage delta pattern and bursts of theta.   
Out of the slow and suppressed pattern, there is an increase in amplitude with rhythmic 2-3 Hz activity from the right temporal region maximum at T2 at 4:42:05.  The clinical features of the seizure include motion arrest.  Then the patient has eye flutter which is more prominent on the right.  He has eye blinking and oral automatisms.  He is initially responsive during the beginning of the seizure.  He has oral automatisms, eye flutter followed by postictal obtundation.   
This seizure is 1 minute and 20 seconds in duration.  It begins with rhythmic repetitive delta at T2 and then repetitive sharp waves at T2-T4.  These are approximately 19 seconds in duration before we have a higher amplitude 4-5 Hz discharge really in the right hemisphere with slowing and volume conduction to the left.  When the seizure is over, the background EEG is markedly slow and the patient is quite somnolent.  He rolls over on his stomach and it becomes very difficult to maintain good quality electrodes.  He is markedly obtunded postictally. 
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An electrographic seizure which was clinically a complex partial seizure out of the right temporal region.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The seizure occurred early in the EEG.  Aside from the seizure itself, there were few epileptiform discharges.


CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old male with acute CNS pathology, found unresponsive. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Etomidate, Rocuronium, Gabapentin, Tramadol, Lisinopril, ASA 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal with a pattern of background theta with some delta. There is a prominent epileptiform focus in the posterior regions. This is a periodic or PLEDS and focus at P3, O1, T5, and occasionally C3. There is variability in amplitude and field spread, and there is some involvement occasionally in the right occipital region. At 4:54, an electrographic seizure is recorded. The physicians at the bedside noticed no change in the patient's behavior but rhythmic repetitive theta frequency activity is observed with clear frequency evolution. When that discharge is over, the epileptiform activity seems to have abated briefly, and then recurs at 4:57. These findings are reviewed with the team, and a plan is made at 5:10 for long-term EEG monitoring. 
HR: 100 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Electrographic status epilepticus. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern is characteristic of an electrographic seizure. These findings were discussed with the clinical team. 


CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 80-year-old woman who has a history of epilepsy in the 1970s.  Seizures characterized by butterflies in her stomach with a rising sensation to her forehead followed by loss of consciousness and generalized motor activity.  Seizures abated.  The patient reports 4 or more strokes in the 1980s and early 2000s and was admitted to Temple recently for transient hemiparesis (unclear if left or right) successfully treated with TPA.  The patient subsequently had episodes with generalized shaking followed by the absence of a post ictal period.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, Plavix, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had a single event on the morning of the 10th.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with __________ rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  The patient transitions in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with spindles.  In sleep there are rare bursts of shifting slowing. 
The seizure and spike detector picks up 2 artifacts but no electrographic seizures were identified.
EVENT:  Seizure time 11:59 a.m.  The patient was awake.  She had been talking on the phone and appeared to be having a pleasant conversation.  The nurse enters and the patient is verbally unresponsive.  The push button alarm was pushed.  The patient cannot speak during the event, although as time goes on she looks at her examiners and then begins to follow some commands such as cooperating with an eye exam.  The patient was placed in the bed. 
The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern throughout the event.  There are occasional PVCs but no significant dysrhythmias noted with this 4-minute event.   
Heart rate 60-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for a behavioral event with verbal unresponsiveness and loss of awareness with a normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are most compatible with a non-epileptic seizure.  In this patient with a past history of epilepsy and multiple previous strokes, no significant focal features were noted.


REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with a history of HIV, seizures, history of a left stroke with right hemiparesis, status post cranioplasty and head trauma, here for an EEG due to seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, pravastatin, vitamin B12, aspirin, folic acid, Atripla, ferrous sulfate, docusate, Ofloxacin otic solution, guaifenesin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage 1.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Very frequent sharp waves seen at F7/T3 during wakefulness and sleep.  
Focal slow waves seen continuously at F3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts,  in addition increase faster frequencies over that region consistent with a breach rhythm.
SEIZURES:  
A seizure was seen at 10:52 a.m.  lasting for 23.6 seconds which electrographically appeared to evolve in the left hemisphere mainly at F7/T3 starting with a delta frequency discharge that appears to be increase in amplitude and frequency, and slow down to sharp waves with a sudden ending.  Clinically, the patient was lying in the chair and reveal any changes.  When questioned at the end of the seizure she appeared to follow commands.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a single left temporal electrographic seizure, in addition to frequent left temporal sharp waves and continuous left frontal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of localization related epilepsy with a single seizure arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region, which is consistent with the known stroke and craniotomy.


DATE OF STUDY:  11/19/2012 to 11/20/2012, for a total of 17 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old woman found covered in urine and feces with a glucose of 1200 and with myoclonus, has a previous possible left MCA infarct and brain atrophy on the CT scan.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and fosphenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed from 11/19/2012 to 11/20/2012 using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temple single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recording will unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is consistent of diffuse delta slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There is also some burst suppression seen intermittently.  Superimposed over this background are rhythmic low amplitude of what appears to be polyspikes which at times appear to have a left frontal predominance and sometimes right frontal predominance, and at times they are seen diffusely followed by a beta discharge.  During everyone of these discharges the patient has a jerk which moves her head towards the left and at times towards the right.  In addition to this continuous discharge that occurs at times there is an O2 more than O1 beta discharge that starts suddenly and appears to increase in frequency and then slow down and stop suddenly, occurring frequently throughout the recording.  There is no clinical correlate with this second discharge.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts with intermittent suppression seen for 2-3 seconds.  
Bursts of polyspikes of low amplitude and followed by beta discharges seen diffusely, at times with a left frontal and sometimes a right frontal predominance with associated jerking consistent with myoclonus.  
Multiple frequent electrographic seizures arising from the right occipital region consisting of beta evolving in frequency and amplitude which have a sudden onset and end.
IMPRESSION:  
Abnormal electroencephalography due to generalized polyspikes with clinical myoclonus as well as multiple right occipital electrographic seizures and marked diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with severe cerebral dysfunction and irritability with clinical myoclonus, which is consistent with a severe diffuse injury which could be seen with diffuse anoxic injury and sometimes with diffuse metabolic injury.  In addition, there is focal electrographic seizures arising from the right occipital region.  The seizures appear to continue throughout the recording.The myoclonus seems to improve during the last hours of the recording, but not the occipital seizures.  These findings were informed to the primary team as the EEG was reviewed.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old woman found unconscious with urine and feces with a glucose of 1200 with myoclonus that has since subsided.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, insulin, Zosyn.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temple single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is attenuated and slow at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts.  This is intermixed with short-lasting occipital beta discharges that at the beginning last for about 10-15 seconds and as the record progresses, they have become shorter in duration, lasting only 3-6 seconds.  In addition, there is intermittent bilateral frontal sharp waves seen at times simultaneously and at times independently.  In the last hour, the EEG has become more attenuated and has intermittent suppression seen. No longer the patient can be seen twitching during this recording in the video.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Bilateral anterior frontal sharp waves, at times some on the left, at times some on the right, and at times simultaneously.
Rhythmic data discharge in the occipital region that at the beginning of the recording appears to evolve, but later it stops evolving and becomes much shorter and with a definite start and stop.  This was more consistent with electrographic seizures, but the later discharges appear to be irritated brain in the occipital region, mainly at __________ 
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-30 microvolts which over the last hour of the recording have become lower in amplitude and more with intermittent suppression.
SEIZURES:  Please note that the occipital electrographic seizures have subsided and become short-lasting electrical discharges in the occipital region at the end of the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior frontal sharp waves, occipital electrographic seizures as well as generalized flowing and diffuse attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  
This EEG reveals evidence of cortical irritability in the bifrontal regions with addition of focus of irritability in the occipital region with a high likelihood of seizures possibly arising from this region.  In addition, there is evidence of marked to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is likely due to the hyperglycemia and/or __________ effect.  No seizures are seen at the end of the recording.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of left parieto-occipital lung metastasis removed approximately 3 weeks ago.  She now presents with change in mental status that is accompanied by several convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin and Decadron.
INTRODUCTION:  Conditions of the Recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  This is a 24-hour continuous video EEG recording.  The recording was reviewed on several occasions throughout the 24-hour period.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms and high amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere consists of low amplitude polymorphic 8-9 Hz activity.  There is anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the right hemisphere.  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere and the anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is weak.  There are continuous semirhythmic and rhythmic moderate amplitude sharp waves with upgoing slow waves observed over the left posterior quadrant, with maximal scalp negativity over T5 and 01 electrodes.  Frequently, these epileptiform discharges are accompanied by low amplitude fast activity.  Frequency of these discharges on average is approximately 1 Hz.  Additionally, they frequently transform into brief poorly organized runs of polymorphic theta and delta with imbedded sharp waves.  This EEG pattern represents ictal interictal continuum.  On several occasions, frank discrete electrographic seizures are  observed.  These start with approximately 1 Hz sharp waves with upgoing slow waves with accompanied fast activity observed over the left posterior quadrant.  This activity increases in frequency into the theta range.  It gradually evolves into approximately 2-1/2 to 3 Hz sharp wave contoured left posterior quadrant delta activity that spreads to the left temporal leads.  These seizures have poorly defined electrographic onset.  They last approximately 60 seconds and in example of such, a seizure occurs at about 6:03 p.m.  As the recording progresses, such seizures become better defined.  These seizures occur several times an hour.  Additionally, as the recording progresses, diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured and periods of discontinuity are noted.  No normal sleep architecture is captured, however, periods of quiescence are noted.  Starting at approximately 8 p.m., there is progressive electrode artifact that eventually affects multiple leads.  The leads were finally fixed at approximately 8:12 a.m.
FINDINGS:  
Ictal interictal continuum emanating from the left posterior quadrant early in the recording.
Discrete focal 15-90 second left posterior quadrant seizures, that are defined as the recording progresses and occur several times per hour in the second half of the recording.
Continuous approximately 1 Hz PLEDs, quasi-PLEDs and PLEDs plus in the left posterior quadrant, with maximal scalp negativity over T5 and 01 electrodes.
Focal left posterior quadrant slowing.
Increase in degree of slowing as the recording progresses.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to left posterior quadrant continuous rhythmic and semi-rhythmic epileptiform discharges, left posterior quadrant ictal interictal continuum, and left posterior quadrant discrete electrographic seizures that become better defined as the recording progresses.  Additionally, there is left posterior quadrant focal slowing.  These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction over the left posterior quadrant, and in this patient consistent with a history of prior left parieto-occipital lobe resection.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 65-year-old woman with recent left parietoccipital removal of lung metastasis, who now presents with change in mental status and several convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Depakote, phenobarbital, versed, and Decadron.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  The recording was performed continuously at the patient's bedside.  Video capability was activated.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is isolated left anterior hemispheric asymmetry with slow wave forms and a high amplitude over the left hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude, mixture of theta and delta activity.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta mixed with continuous approximately 1 Hz semi-rhythmic and rhythmic sharp waves with after-going slow waves with maximum scalp negativity over T5 and L1 electrodes.  As the recording progresses, amplitude periodicity and frequency of the discharges becomes less pronounced.  Diffuse periods of discontinuity as well as increasing degree of bursts of diffuse beta are captured.  Occasional left posterior quadrant electrographic seizures are captured.  Frequency of these seizures decreases as the recording progresses.  A left side electrographic seizure is calculated at approximately 2:16 p.m.  Seizure starts with approximately 1 Hz rhythmic sharp waves with after-going slow waves with rapidly decrease in amplitude and evolved into the sharply contoured theta activity with embedded 2 Hz sharp waves with after-going slow waves.  This activity evolves into approximately 2.5-3 Hz sharply contoured delta activity with under-riding faster frequencies and spreads throughout the left hemisphere.  That seizure was approximately 40 seconds.  No normal sleep architecture is observed.
FINDINGS:  
Occasional left posterior quadrant focal brief electrographic seizures that decrease in frequency as the recording progresses, with left __________ seizure at approximately 2:16 p.m.
Continuous left posterior quadrant rhythmic and semi-rhythmic epileptiform discharges (rather than quasi PLEDs) that decrease in frequency, amplitude, and as the recording progresses.
Moderate diffuse background slowing with period of discontinuity, degree of which fluctuates throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 20-hour continuous audio EEG monitoring due to occasional left posterior quadrant seizures and continuous left posterior quadrant semi-periodic and periodic epileptiform discharges that decrease in frequency and periodicity as the recording progresses.  These findings indicate underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology and is consistent with this patient's history of recent tumor resection.  Diffuse background slowing indicates etiology for nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction and is consistent with this patient with a history of medication use.  Diffuse excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.


LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 68-year-old man status post traumatic brain injury with resultant right temporal confusion, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage who experienced 2  tonic-clonic convulsions last night.  The patient is currently comatose and intubated.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard the 10-20  system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed at the bedside.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic, very well amplitude theta and delta activity admixed with prominent beta activity.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic variable amplitude delta greater than theta as well as under riding faster activity admixed with moderate amplitude sharp waves with after going slow waves emanating from the right frontocentral region.  Phase reversal occurs over F8/F4/C4 electrodes.  There are several electrographic seizures throughout the recording, lasting on average approximately 1 minute.  These seizures are characterized by increase in frequency of sharp waves with after going slow waves observed over the right frontocentral region.  Seizures are characterized by a gradual increase in frequency of epileptiform discharges to approximately theta delta range and then gradually decreasing in frequency and stopping.  Additionally occasional periods of brief background discontinuity are noted.  It is not clear is these seizures have a clinical correlation; however, however on 1 occasion the EEG technologist notices the patient squints at the onset of seizure.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:  
Moderate diffuse slowing. 
Focal right hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the right anterior region. 
Frequent right frontocentral epileptiform discharges, with phase reversal over F8/F4/C4 electrodes.  
Several focal right frontocentral electrographic seizures lasting on average approximately 1 minute. 
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute electroencephalogram due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal right hemispheric slowing, that is most pronounced over the right anterior region, frequent right frontocentral epileptiform discharges and several focal right frontocentral electrographic seizures with unclear clinical correlate.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural etiology and is consistent with the patient's history of traumatic brain injury.  There is an electrographic focus emanating from the right frontocentral region.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team at the time of the review.

Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural etiology and is consistent with the patient's history of traumatic brain injury.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of a MCA stroke and seizures, as well as liver failure who now presents with a change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Potassium, propranolol, rifaximin, lisinopril, Lasix, Protonix, Lovenox, aspirin, Thiamine, Keppra, Zonisamide, spironolactone, and risperidone.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta.  Additional moderate amplitude frontally predominant intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) is observed.  During sleep the degree of slowing increases, occasionally.  The discontinuity is observed, and the sleep spindles are noted.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  Four seizures were observed.  The seizures occurred at 12:23:01 p.m., 12:26 p.m., 12:45:18 p.m., and 12:48:23 p.m.  The longest seizure duration was approximately 80 seconds.  The seizures start with lower amplitude fast activity over the left  occipital region.  This activity rapidly increases in amplitude and becomes more sharply contoured and rhythmic.  As seizure evolves additional rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity is observed over the left frontal central region with significant reflection over the rest of the brain.  As the seizure progresses left occipital activity decreases in frequency and increases in amplitude.  Clinically, the patient is unable to answer questions or follow commands during the seizure.  He repeatedly repeats the word "yeah" when asked to follow commands or answer questions.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:  
Moderate diffuse slowing. 
Moderate focal left hemispheric slowing. 
Electrographic seizures, left occipital onset, up to 80 seconds in duration, occurring in clusters of 2. 
FIRDA.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 42 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left hemisphere, and 4 focal electrographic seizures of left occipital onset.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing and focal left occipital onset seizures indicate focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and is consistent with the patient's history of a left hemispheric stroke.  FIRDA could be seen in encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure and white matter lesions.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology Team at the time of the review.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 65-year-old man with a past medical history of stroke and seizures who now presents with a change in mental status and subsequently found to have focal status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zonisamide, phenobarbital, and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Spike detector and seizure detector software were activated.  Nursing staff and medical staff notes were reviewed.  The recording was reviewed intermittently throughout the recording epoch.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During maximal wakefulness the background consisted of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is captured, however, periods of quiescence characterized by diffuse spindle-like wave forms and intermittent periods of brief background discontinuity are captured.   Electrographic seizures occur on the average of approximately 1 per hour.  The last electrographic seizure occurs at approximately 8:30 p.m.  Seizure duration on the average is approximately 1 minute.  Electrographically seizure starts with rhythmic alpha frequency range activity observed over the left frontal region.  This activity rapidly spreads throughout the left parasagittal region and over the left anterior temple region.  A seizure evolves, rhythmic theta increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency with some reflection over the right hemisphere.  There is a gradual decrease in the wave form frequency until seizure gradually stops.  No official neurological testing is performed during any of these events.  Beta review does not demonstrate clear associated clinical correlation.  The last seizure captured was at approximately 8:30 p.m.  This corresponds to IV loading the patient with Dilantin shortly prior to the last seizure.
FINDINGS:  
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Frequent brief periods of discontinuity, especially during sleep.
Intermittent focal electrographic seizures, with onset over the left frontal region, occurring on the average of once an hour and lasting for approximately 60 minutes.  Last such seizure occurred at approximately 8:30.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left hemisphere as well as intermittent focal seizures of left frontal onset.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric swelling and electrographic seizures indicate underlying focal cerebral dysfunction and is consistent with the patient's history of prior left hemispheric stroke.  The last recorded seizure was at approximately 8:30 p.m.  Discontinuation of seizures occurs soon after the patient was loaded with IV Dilantin.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology team.


REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman who presents with worsening right-sided weakness and a headache, history of HIV, cervical cancer and multiple cerebral infarcts.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and asleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges which included photic stimulation.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage 1.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Slow waves seen at F7/T3 and sometimes at F3 independently with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Focal sharp waves seen at CZ.  Please see below in seizures.
SEIZURES:  There are intermittent sharply contoured focal slow waves that occur periodically throughout the recording and in the mid central region correlate with right leg twitching consistent with cortical discharge and a simple partial seizure.  They occurred multiple times throughout the recording.  They do not appear to evolve or increase in rhythm or spread anywhere.
HEART RATE:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing as well as simple partial seizures arising from the central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal simple partial seizures arising from the central region, which are consistent with the known lesions in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is also consistent with the lesions. This report was dictated and communicated to the team.


CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed woman with new onset seizures characterized by right leg jerking movements and unresponsiveness. History of anxiety disorder. First ever seizure on 9/29/2010. 
MEDICATIONS: None. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient reports feeling anxious at the start of the study. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the background EEG opens, the patient has generous background beta. There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with rhythmic activity in the right temporal region. For some reason, there is a pause in the EEG at the beginning of the record. The patient is staring forward. When the EEG resumes at 1:27:01, there is artifact, but the minute that the artifact stops, the EEG demonstrates a clear, high amplitude, right anterior temporal seizure with 4 to 5 Hz activity in the right temporal region with an admix spike. 
The activity is extremely high amplitude with a phase reversal atF8 and T2. The activity ends abruptly at 1:38:56. The overall duration of the seizure appears to be approximately 3 minutes but the seizure onset is unclear. By the end of the seizure, the activity is involving the right frontal region and also the midline and to a lesser extent the left frontal region. 
Immediately afterward, the patient is able to answer questions but is amnestic for the event. Following the seizure, occasional arrhythmic delta activity is seen in the right temporal region with a complex. The patient drifts into stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts. The patient is in stage II sleep during photic stimulation. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Complex partial seizure from the right temporal region. 
2. Right temporal sharp waves. 
3. Rhythmic slowing from the right temporal region noted prior to the seizure. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed woman status post left MCA aneurysm repaired in 2003 with annual exacerbation of complex partial seizures and low serum levels. 
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a prolonged study for a patient who appeared to have had a subclinical seizure. She was confused during the EEG and somewhat lethargic. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background from the right hemisphere is slow and disorganized. The left hemisphere includes a high amplitude breech rhythm with a left frontal sharp and slow complex with arrhythmic delta activity. 
At 9:15 the patient is relatively inattentive and the technologist wraps the head. At some point essentially continuous spiking is noted in the left frontal region. 
A seizure is identified at 9:19 characterized by evolution of epileptiform activity in the left frontal region, which is high amplitude with a generous field of spread. The seizure duration is from 19:13:30 to 19:19:59 suggesting that this is a relatively brief seizure. The technologist transitions from this to additional recording at 09:21. After the first event with impaired responsiveness, high amplitude left frontal spiking is noted with a breech rhythm in the abnormal background. The patient's mental status actually improves somewhat. She moves about, although she is confused. The activity remains quite slow in both hemispheres. 
There was another brief build up again at 9:40. Artifacts are picked up at 9:35, but again there is prominent spiking in the background with very prominent epileptiform activity. 
A third electrographic seizure occurs at 9:58:57. The patient is relatively somnolent. Stimulation of the patient does not occur during this testing, but the seizure stops by itself and as it does the patient moves about. 
By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow. 
Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate. 
Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor. Her head is off the monitor. She appears to be sleepy. At  13:35 she was awake and the seizure is 12 minutes later. At 13:44 with the patient with someone at the bedside, in fact a physician examining her, the left frontal delta is prominent as are some sharp waves but she is interactive somewhat with the individual examining her. As the student leaves, the patient drifts over to the right. 
The electrographic seizure is at 13:47:13 and the patient is not really moving during the event but starts to reposition afterwards. 
This event is characterized by rhythmic, faster frequency activity in the left frontal and temporal region with also a beta accentuation. 
After the seizure was over, the patient looks about. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 
1. Well-defined electrographic seizures noted but with only one seizure In the last 24 hours of recording. 
2. Left frontotemporal focus. 
3. Focal slowing from the left. 
4. Generalized background slowing quite marked in the beginning of the record but better at the close of the record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related 
mechanism for epilepsy. Additional recording may be appropriate if this patient's mental status does not improve. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: This section of EEG, which includes a routine 20 minute EEG, followed by 50 minutes of recording, includes multiple, brief complex partial seizures. Although the patient's mental status is abnormal, the clinical correlate for this patient's seizures includes impaired responsiveness. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the LTM unit using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. The patient has a pattern of improving mental status over the course of the day. She, unfortunately, eliminated her EEG electrodes during the overnight recording. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the improved clinical appearance of the patient, there are electrographic seizures identified. These occur when the patient is in bed sleeping, without clinical correlate. They are associated with runs and bursts of activity. 
Time: 19:0838 - Approximately 1 minute in duration. 
Time: 19:5442 - Another seizure, maximum, in the left frontal and temporal region with a generous field of spread. Of note, the majority of the electrographic seizures are at approximately 8 p.m. and shortly thereafter the patient starts to remove the EEG electrodes. Of note, however, the patient did receive Versed in the morning and although there were frequent high amplitude left frontocentral sharp waves, the 
recurrence of seizures was primarily many hours afterwards. 
INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Electrographic seizures for this individual were well-defined with characteristic frequency evolution despite the prominent interictal sharp waves from the left frontocentral region and frontotemporal region. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. At least one electrographic seizure is noted but no clinical seizures are observed. The patient's mental status gradually improves over the course of the record with the patient able to eat and get out of bed as well as participate in care. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections in this epoch include a markedly slow pattern with slower delta and rhythmic theta frequency from both hemispheres and high amplitude sharp and slow or spike and slow wave complexes, many of which are frontotemporal but some of which are T1. The patient is certainly much sleepier on the 6th compared to the 7th.
By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow. 
Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate. 
Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor. Her head is off the monitor. She appears to be sleepy. At  13:35 she was awake and the seizure is 12 minutes later. At 13:44 with the patient with someone at the bedside, in fact a physician examining her, the left frontal delta is prominent as are some sharp waves but she is interactive somewhat with the individual examining her. As the student leaves, the patient drifts over to the right. 
The electrographic seizure is at 13:47:13 and the patient is not really moving during the event but starts to reposition afterwards. 
This event is characterized by rhythmic, faster frequency activity in the left frontal and temporal region with also a beta accentuation. 
After the seizure was over, the patient looks about. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 
1. Well-defined electrographic seizures noted but with only one seizure In the last 24 hours of recording. 
2. Left frontotemporal focus. 
3. Focal slowing from the left. 
4. Generalized background slowing quite marked in the beginning of the record but better at the close of the record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. Additional recording may be appropriate if this patient's mental status does not improve. 


CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult male status post gunshot wound to chest and back.  At 4:00 a.m. today the patient had generalized tonic-clonic seizures requiring 7 mg of Ativan.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Fentanyl, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is comatose, unresponsive, with intermittent eye blinking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes multiple electrographic seizures which are clinically associated with eye blink.  Much of the EEG is, in fact, ictal with seizures seeming to wax and wane.  It is difficult at this point to determine when seizures begin and end, but the very first seizure for this patient seems to begin with a burst of rhythmic higher amplitude sharply contoured activity on the left.  Many of the seizures are characterized by high amplitude rhythmic theta-delta or spike-and-wave activity which is essentially bilateral.  Some seizures end with T6 spiking.  Others end with rhythmic sharply contoured activity on the left.  As the recording continues, the seizures begin with faster frequency activity alpha and beta out of the frontal regions and then a paroxysmal evolution.  Some of the seizures do have a clearly defined ending with a slow background and then the T6 periodic sharp waves.  There are sections of the record where there is a T6 sharp wave and a T1 burst of sharply contoured delta.  
As the recording continues, more of the epileptiform activity is in the right hemisphere and may be posterotemporal or anterior temporal. 
By 12:34, the nurse is providing Ativan.  As the record ends at 12:40, epileptiform activity is noted and has not resolved. 
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Multiple electrographic seizures which seem to emanate from the frontal regions but at least in some locations either begin or end with epileptiform activity in the left frontal or even right posterotemporal region.
Interictal epileptiform activity from multiple different localizations including T1, T3, T4, and T6. 
Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a complex partial status epilepticus.  Based on these findings, continuous video EEG monitoring was initiated.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old male, status epilepticus, status post gunshot wound with anoxic injury.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is comatose, but is noted to have some movements of the eyes and the arm.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG over 5 hours demonstrates an ongoing, ictal pattern with different seizure types including bifrontal rhythmic sharply contoured activity with frequency evolution, right mid or posterior temporal seizures and less frequently left anterior temporal seizures.  In the sections of the record when the patient is not seizing, the background EEG is markedly slow and poorly organized.   
HR:    135 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Continuous electrographic seizures with multiple different localizations, frontal, right posterior temporal, lower left anterior temporal. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance.  The status epilepticus had not resolved by the end of the EEG.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed male with past CNS toxoplasmosis, encephalopathy, recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lorazepam, Phenobarbital
 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is noted to have intermittent seizures characterized by eye blinking, grimacing and turning to the right. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins on the afternoon of 10/12/2010, recurrent electrographic seizures are noted which begin with a buzz of fast activity, which is primarily in the left posterior quadrant including T5, 02 and P3. The activity demonstrates more of a generalized buzz and then repetitive sharp waves in the left posterior quadrant including T4, 01 and P3. Typical seizures are 1 to 2 minutes in duration. As the recording begins, brief seizures less than 1 minute are noted at 5:40 p.m. 
The seizures begin to abate overnight and they are not as continuous in the overnight sections of the recording. 
Lacosamide is administered late in the day on 10/12/2010 and in the morning of 10/13/2010. Despite this, there are seizures at 3:40 in the afternoon on 10/13/2010. Although this review ends at 4:48, following the initiation of phenobarbital, the seizures do appear to be slowing. Additional seizures are noted at 3:44. The patient is somewhat drowsy following the administration of phenobarbital. As the recording continues, the eye blinking and clinical features of seizures remain with eye blinking and posturing of the patient's arms. 
HR: 72 bpm. 
LONG TERM MONITORING 10/14/2010 - 10-114 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Occasional clinical seizures are noted by the team. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Electrographic seizures are identified including at 6:07 p.m. The seizures are identical to those seen in the initial section with a buzz of 20 Hz activity which begins in the left occipital region. Using an average reference, this is clearly maximum at T5 and 01. This activity builds up and a beta activity spreads throughout the posterior quadrant on the left and then more diffusely throughout the left hemisphere. It is also picked up in the right occipital region. This is followed by repetitive spike activity, which is maximum in the left occipital region but again has a diffuse representation with frequency evolution noted over the first 30 seconds. Today the seizures abate in the left temporal region but continue a little bit more in the left parietal region and then are followed by background slowing.
 
The seizure detector is a reliable index for this patient and seizures are observed at 6:07 p.m., 7:36, 7:52, 8:05, 8:14, 8:22, 8:30, 8:34, 8:41, 8:49, 8:56, 9:03, 9:09, 9:34, 9:40 and 9:55. At this time, Ativan is given. With the last dose of Ativan, there is a dramatic decrease in the seizures after the 10 p.m. dose. There are seizure markings at 
5 a.m. which are not associated with seizures. 
Recording continues in the morning of 10/14/2010, and at this point, the patient is awake. The background is more of a theta frequency pattern. No additional seizures are noted. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: CLINICAL CORRELATION: This 48 hour long term video EEG monitoring session is characterized by: Complex partial status epilepticus which improves dramatically in the first 24 hours of the record and in the second 24 hours, there are sections in the record with 1 seizure per hour to as many as 8 seizures per hour but with a dramatic decrease after the last dose of Ativan. At present, the patient's status epilepticus appears to have resolved.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old female, who was admitted for change in mental status.  She has a history of diabetes, hypertension, depression, and breast cancer.MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Haldol, lorazepam, labetalol, vancomycin, aztreonam, lisinopril.INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At 11:22:17 a.m., there is a seizure onset at 9-10 Hz alpha activity, maximum in left occipital region (01) with spread to left posterior quadrant and right occipital region, after 20 seconds seizure activity continues as 4-5 Hz theta activity maximum in left posterior quadrant for 40 seconds.  This activity was followed by sharply contoured delta activity with bihemispheric distribution for 90 seconds.  It was followed by postictal attenuation noted in bihemispheric region.  Clinically, patient did not show shaking or jerking, but per video patient seemed less responsive with eyes closed.  Towards the end of this recording, there were left periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges noted in left posterior quadrant region lasting for several minutes with no evolution. There was almost continuous left posterior quadrant slowing almost continuous noted during this recording.IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;1. Electrographic partial seizure originating from left occipital/left posterior quadrant region.2. Left posterior quadrant slowing.3. Left periodic lateralized epileptiform CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing is a consistent with functional or structural abnormality in left posterior quadrant. PLEDs (Periodic Lateralized Epileptiform Discharges) are consistent with left hemisphere structural lesion (tumor, infection, and stroke). It could also be due to a post-ictal state. One episode of electrographic focal seizure is consistent with partial epilepsy in the setting of Hx of seizure. Clinical correlation and long-term monitoring are recommended. DATE OF THE RECORDING:  05/16/2013 from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 05/17/2013 until approximately 2:00 p.m.  Total time of the recording is approximately 24 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of seizures who now presents with recurrent complex partial seizures and a change in behavior, subsequently found to have status epilepticus.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Versed, phenobarbital.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.   
The recording was reviewed on several occasions during the 24 hour recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency gradient.  The background consists mostly of a mixture of low amplitude delta activity with underwriting faster frequencies and 1 to 4 second diffuse bursts of spindle-like waveforms.  No clear normal architecture is captured.  Multiple electrographic seizures of variable duration are noted throughout the recording.  Seizure duration varies from 30 seconds to over 30 minutes.  Seizure onset is often poorly localized.  Some start with bilateral central frontal fast activity that increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency to the alpha range.  More prolonged seizures start with diffuse frontally predominant delta activity with underwriting by frontocentral faster activity.  This activity increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency, and spreads throughout other cerebral regions.  During multiple long seizures the seizure output is not clear.  There has been some tachycardia noted on a electrocardiogram lead.  During seizures heart rate increases to approximately 120 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:  
Intermittent electrographic seizures with poor localization and lateralization with variable durations from 30 seconds to approximately 30 minutes.  
Moderate to severe diffuse slowing and low amplitude attenuation.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24 hour EEG due to intermittent seizures and frank status epilepticus as well as moderate to severe diffuse slowing.  The slowing indicates etiological nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, and in this case likely related to medication effect.  These findings were conveyed to the Primary Team.


LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Twenty-two minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 2, now presents with concern for status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include:  Lamictal and 8 mg of Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of diffuse rhythmic and semi-rhythmic high amplitude frontally predominant delta activity mixed with bursts of diffuse spindle-like wave forms.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  At least 3 electrographic seizures are noted. These seizures start with approximately a 10-12 second run of fast activity most pronounced over the right occipital lead.  This activity eventually spread to the right anterior region. During this spread, rhythmic more frequency theta and delta activity are captured over the right anterior leads with some reflection over the left hemisphere.  Seizure offset is gradual.  Total seizure duration is approximately one minute.  Increase in heart rate up to 150 to 180 beats a minutes is noted during seizure.  During one of the seizures, the patient bites on the ET tube.   
A single EKG lead demonstrates continued tachycardia with heart rate on average of approximately 120 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:  
At least 3 electrographic seizures with right occipital onset lasting approximately 1 minute.  
Runs of bilateral posterior fast activity. 
Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to moderate diffuse slowing, intermittent high frequency activity observed posteriorly, as well as 3 focal right hemisphere electrographic seizures with onset of right occipital leads.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction, that in this case could partially be related to medications.  There is a seizure onset focus that is suspected to be over the right occipital region.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.


DATE OF THE RECORDING:  05/16/2013 from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 05/17/2013 until approximately 2:00 p.m.  Total time of the recording is approximately 24 hours.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  41 year old male with recurrent focal status epilepticus for individual on Coumadin with seizure, fell in the bathroom, hit his head.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Phenobarbital, Lacosamide, Topamax, Lisinopril, Pantoprazole, Lipitor
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient has a number of seizures, all of which he describes as remaining awake and aware throughout.  The seizures may include right hemi-sensory phenomenon or right-sided shaking.  He has some tremulousness on the left, but is alert and can use the left hand.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The activity on the right includes excess beta and is somewhat slow and disorganized. The interictal spikes in the EEG recording are primarily high amplitude polyspike and tend to have a large field of spread in the left hemisphere including posterior temporal and central temporal. Most seizures are quite brief, some just 30 seconds in duration clinically.  They began with some activity in the central regions which may or may not be associated with suppression of the high-amplitude spikes on the right.  There is often a period of time before there is a clear clinical change.  There is theta noted from the right hemisphere during the seizures and in these seizures using different montages, there is prominent spread in the left hemisphere. 
There are 8 pushbuttons, 6 well-defined electrographic seizures overall. 
HR:    72 bpm
INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  By the end of the EEG recording, the epileptiform activity was improving.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep, in wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude left posterior temporal spike complex.   
Clinical seizures are noted reliably with the patient and nurse and there are more than 20 pushbutton events, approximately 23, all 30-60 seconds in duration.  They are characterized by focal motor activity on the right hemibody.  Electrocardiographically, there is a buzz of mixed 5 and 10 Hz activity in the left hemisphere including the central regions.   There are a handful of seizures that when seizures occur as pairs where there is a bit more of a rhythmic delta pattern that precedes it.  So, if there are 2 seizures together, the second is not as well defined as the first.  Many of the seizures occur in sleep.  Some seem to have a beta buzz early on in the seizure.   
HR:    80 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour section of EEG monitoring was remarkable for a large number of seizures.  The most disturbing seem to be have been those that occurred in sleep, but in fact, they were also seen in the early evening hours as well.  There may have been other events that looked like seizures, but were not associated with a pushbutton event and those occurred with the patient off camera, so it is difficult to know if these were clinically significant or not.  Of note, there are other sections in the 
record where the patient seems to have had seizures while sleeping which did not seem to disrupt his sleep at all.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The interictal EEG continues to demonstrate focal slowing from the left hemisphere with left posterior temporal sharp waves.  Multiple seizures are identified in the 24 hour section, including in wakefulness and sleep.  The patient does not seem to wake up for all of them.  Stage II sleep, including the 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. section are prominent.  The nurses were aware of the seizures in sleep.  These seizures seem to be beginning with a burst of fast activity, almost some 10 to 5 Hz which is picked up very close to the midline.  The activity is really very prominent at CZ where it is a 10 Hz discharge.  This evolves to more of a theta frequency pattern and then the posterior temporal spikes continue.  Most seizures are under 30 seconds in duration. 
HR:    80 bpm
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside.  During a section of the record, the patient has approximately 40 simple partial seizures, all characterized by involuntary movements on the right.  Other seizures can occur out of sleep, but in this 24-hour section almost all the seizures seem to wake him up and are associated with right-sided shaking.   
The seizures have variable patterns, but all localize to the left hemisphere.  Some seem to start with a beta buzz in the left central region, others with more higher amplitude spike and wave activity.  The interictal activity includes a pattern with excess beta and theta from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates __________ delta and the epileptiform activity interictally is more of a polyspike activity in the left posterior temporal region or central parietal region.   The seizures had improved.
HR:    80 bpm 
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed for this individual.  He has many seizures typically characterized by right-sided shaking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of the seizures occur on the evening of the 26th with multiple, repetitive focal seizures.  Aside from this, he demonstrates stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.  By the later sections of the record on the 27th, the patient has more significant sections where he is awake, doing well and then drifting off to sleep.  This piece of EEG concludes at 3:24 on the 27th.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG recording is performed in the Long-Term Monitoring Unit using 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   
This section of the record captures a 5:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. period.  The patient has relatively few clinical seizures in the overnight recording.  There are some subclinical rhythmic beta discharges from the left hemisphere.  Left occipital temporal polyspike activity is noted, as well as some polyspike activity in sleep with a more generous field of spread throughout the left hemisphere including left central regions.   
Clinical events are noted with a beta buzz and a sensory seizure at 9:28 p.m., and a more typical clinical seizure at 10:59 p.m.  This seizure is characterized by tremulousness in the right arm and leg.  The onset of this seizure is not as well defined as some of the others.  It seems to come out of some periodic slowing and sharp activity in the left hemisphere, and that activity is present for about 30 seconds before the clinical shaking stops.  Like most of the patient's seizures, it is approximately 30 seconds in duration.  Additional seizures are noted at 11:52.  Additional seizures at 12:42, 1:08 a.m., 1:16, 1:31, 1:07:46.  The 1:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. section is again remarkable for significant seizures, which are focal seizures, as was the patient's pattern throughout this hospitalization.  Seizures seem to stop around 2:30 in the morning.  Additional seizures are noted at 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term video EEG monitoring was remarkable for many seizures with worsening of the total number of seizures over the weekend but gradual improvement toward the end of the long-term monitoring recording.  Of note, the evening hours seem to be the most prominent with very prominent seizures at that time.  This pattern is similar to previous patterns for this individual.


MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed, Depakote, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with multiple strokes, AICD, status post cardiac arrest on the 10th with prolonged arrest in the field on 09/09/2013, now intubated comatose with facial twitching.  The patient will undergo therapeutic hypothermia.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The routine EEG begins at 9:13 in the morning.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and demonstrates an intermittently suppressed pattern.  The patient has intermittent facial twitching and jerking.  This produces muscle artifact.  The jerking demonstrates frequency evolution with clinical seizures lasting approximately 30-60 seconds.  These are followed by an attenuated background or suppressed background with low voltage delta. Both muscle artifact and epileptiform activity localize to the left scalp electrodes
Tactile stimulation does not activate the record. 
Heart rate irregular at 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  
A markedly abnormal pattern with suppressed pattern and sharp waves and spikes, which may emanate from the left (significant muscle artifact).
Recurrent electrographic seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Based on this initial study, long-term video EEG monitoring was initiated.


CLINICAL HISTORY:   44 year old man with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, phenobarbital, and Topamax.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and nurses' alarm noted events were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves at F7/T3 seen occasionally in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts. 
SEIZURES:  Seizure #1, 07/18/2012 at 10:30 a.m., complex partial seizure.  In the video, the patient suddenly places down his cell phone.  Suddenly his arms raise and he lays back.  After this, the right arm suddenly becomes dystonic and stiff.  He starts having automatic movements with the left arm, playing around with the cell phone and the sheet, and his face remains in a staring fashion.  At times he moves his mouth.  He continues this behavior during the entirety of the seizure.   
EEG:  The EEG seizure started at 10:33 a.m. and ended at 10:34 a.m. The EEG correlate to the seizure started at 7 seconds after the clinical onset.  There is rhythmic theta discharge seen maximally at the beginning at T1/F7, which evolves in frequency and increases in amplitude.  It remains mainly over the T1/F7 electrodes but it spread throughout the whole left hemisphere.  After the end of the seizure, there appears to be an asymmetry of the faster frequencies with a lack of them over the left hemisphere.  End of seizure #1. 
Seizure #2, complex partial seizure, occurred on 07/19/2012, starting at 2:48:57, ending at 2:49:52.  Video behavior:  While in bed the patient starts blinking and moving his mouth.  Suddenly his right arm becomes dystonic and his right eye shuts down and appears to twitch slightly while he continues to move his mouth.  Seconds later, he starts having rhythmic automatisms of the left hand and playing with the sheet.  He continues this behavior until the end of the seizure.   
EEG:  About 10 seconds after clinical onset, the EEG reveals well-formed rhythmic 7 Hz theta discharge, maximal over the T1/F7 electrode, which is slightly obscured by muscle artifact which appears to continue to evolve in frequency and increase in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  The seizure remains on the left hemisphere.  It does not cross to the right.  After the end of the seizure, there appear to be a lot of faster frequencies over that left hemisphere and not noticed over the right.  The seizure lasts for 55 seconds.  End of seizure #2. 
Seizure #3, electrographic seizures.  During the record, he had about 4 distinct electrographic seizures which were comprised of rhythmic runs of F7/T3 theta discharge that appeared to increase slightly in amplitude and then suddenly stop.  These 4 events lasted as long as 4 minutes.  During them, in the video there is no clear clinical correlate.  End of seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
1.  Left anterior temporal sharp waves and slowing. 
2.  Complex partial seizures and multiple electrographic seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term EEG is diagnostic of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region.


CLINICAL HISTORY:   44 year old man with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, phenobarbital, and Topamax.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and nurses' alarm noted events were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves at F7/T3 seen occasionally in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts. 
SEIZURES:  Seizure #1, 07/18/2012 at 10:30 a.m., complex partial seizure.  In the video, the patient suddenly places down his cell phone.  Suddenly his arms raise and he lays back.  After this, the right arm suddenly becomes dystonic and stiff.  He starts having automatic movements with the left arm, playing around with the cell phone and the sheet, and his face remains in a staring fashion.  At times he moves his mouth.  He continues this behavior during the entirety of the seizure.   
EEG:  The EEG seizure started at 10:33 a.m. and ended at 10:34 a.m. The EEG correlate to the seizure started at 7 seconds after the clinical onset.  There is rhythmic theta discharge seen maximally at the beginning at T1/F7, which evolves in frequency and increases in amplitude.  It remains mainly over the T1/F7 electrodes but it spread throughout the whole left hemisphere.  After the end of the seizure, there appears to be an asymmetry of the faster frequencies with a lack of them over the left hemisphere.  End of seizure #1. 
Seizure #2, complex partial seizure, occurred on 07/19/2012, starting at 2:48:57, ending at 2:49:52.  Video behavior:  While in bed the patient starts blinking and moving his mouth.  Suddenly his right arm becomes dystonic and his right eye shuts down and appears to twitch slightly while he continues to move his mouth.  Seconds later, he starts having rhythmic automatisms of the left hand and playing with the sheet.  He continues this behavior until the end of the seizure.   
EEG:  About 10 seconds after clinical onset, the EEG reveals well-formed rhythmic 7 Hz theta discharge, maximal over the T1/F7 electrode, which is slightly obscured by muscle artifact which appears to continue to evolve in frequency and increase in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  The seizure remains on the left hemisphere.  It does not cross to the right.  After the end of the seizure, there appear to be a lot of faster frequencies over that left hemisphere and not noticed over the right.  The seizure lasts for 55 seconds.  End of seizure #2. 
Seizure #3, electrographic seizures.  During the record, he had about 4 distinct electrographic seizures which were comprised of rhythmic runs of F7/T3 theta discharge that appeared to increase slightly in amplitude and then suddenly stop.  These 4 events lasted as long as 4 minutes.  During them, in the video there is no clear clinical correlate.  End of seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
1.  Left anterior temporal sharp waves and slowing. 
2.  Complex partial seizures and multiple electrographic seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term EEG is diagnostic of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old female with resection of a left frontal mass and history of seizures, now status post surgery with recurrent seizures.  She also has a past medical history of bipolar, depression, hypertension, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Zonegran.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software as well as patient's noted and nurse's noted events were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5 Hz which is not reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  There are at times appears to be stage changes and appears to go into sleep, but the normal sleep architecture is not usually seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen at F8/T4 and independently at F7/T3, a little bit more frequently on the left. 
Focal slowing is seen at F8/T4 and at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
There is focal slowing also seen at C3/CZ continuously at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  During the recording and especially particularly in the first 2 hours, there were multiple seizures about 10 noted originating with a rhythmic theta discharge seen at F7/T3 increasing in frequency and decreasing in amplitude at times ping-ponging to the right anterior temporal region and sometimes remaining in the same region, lasting for 30-45 seconds.  During these episodes, the patient appears to have right arm stiffening and mouth movements as well as staring unresponsively.  After the first 2 hours of the recording, there were only 2 seizures seen in the rest of the recording for about 15 hours.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Multiple seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region. 
Bi-temporal sharp waves. 
Background slowing and left central focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of multiple seizures arising from the left temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability arising from both anterior temporal lobes which has a high correlation for seizures arising from either region.  Lastly, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left central region which is consistent with the known tumor resection.  In addition to all this, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Depakote, topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with seizure and spike detection.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Two clinical seizures were identified by the team.   
Seizure:  11:33.  The patient is awake.  He experiences one of his clinical seizures.  He is looking to the left and has speech arrest.  An aid comes in at 11:24 and finds him listening to the patient call device as if it is a phone and unable to speak.  Seizure onset is approximately 11:22, offset is 11:42.  This is milder and a briefer seizure than usual.  He is unable to speak during the seizure, but a bit more attentive than in other seizures.  He drifts off to sleep by 11:55. 
Seizure:  3:00 a.m.  The patient is in the unit, sleeping, he awakens at 2:45.  Seizure begins as approximately 2:49.  He pushed the button for the event.  He looks to the left, but he often looks to the left, and he is slumped over on the left.  A nurse comes in and pats the patient. By 3:12 he is looking about.  The seizure has transitioned to a postictal slow pattern on the right by 3:24.  By 3:34 the patient is able to speak.    
In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a posterior dominant rhythm.  At times that posterior dominant rhythm is disrupted on the right.  Spindle activity is noted in sleep. 
The patient is awake, moving about, chatting on the phone.  Between the seizures, including at 7:27 when blood levels are drawn.   
The patient, on the morning of 11/07/2012, was enjoying his lunch.  He was eating at 12:28.  The EEG demonstrates a normal awake background while he is eating at 12:28.  He is talking at 12:29 to something on the left, although no one seems to be in the room.  There was a burst of slowing on the right hemisphere at 12:29, but the patient continues talking and then resumes eating at 12:29:11. 
The patient puts a large quantity of food on his spoon and then into his mouth on 11:29.  He puts a large piece of bread in his mouth at 12:30.  He starts coughing on the food at 12:32.  As he coughs he produces some artifact in the EEG.  The patient is struggling to get out of bed, drops on the floor at 12:35.  He can be heard trying to cry and to dislodge the food.  The fall from the bed at 12:34 triggers the alarms.  The EEG demonstrates a slow pattern during this event.  The nurses enter and are off camera with the patient on the floor.  They are putting him back in the bed at 12;36, but the patient is vocalizing.  They subsequently suction him.  He has an Ambu bag at 12:43.  There is no evidence of a seizure at this time. 
In this section of the record, the EEG demonstrates generous beta activity.  The patient is sedated and intubated for respiratory distress. 
By the end of this section of the EEG, which is 1:45, there are some arousals noted. 
Heart rate:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour section of the EEG was remarkable for:
Two seizures.
Documented aspiration by the patient of what appeared to be a large piece of bread.


REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old man with history of seizures after stroke, now with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temple single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  After 8 p.m., some of the central leads were lost and by 11 p.m., all the electrodes were lost.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There were limited waveforms, as there appears to be posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which is seen bilaterally and reactive to eye opening.  There is an increased amount of beta seen throughout the recording.
  
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Some intermittent focal slowing can be seen over the right hemisphere at T4/C4.
SEIZURES:  At 5 p.m., the patient had a seizure where during the video, although not clearly seen, it is apparent that the left side of his body was twitching.  However, this is not clearly seen as the video was focused on the right side of his body.  In the EEG, there is muscle artifact seen maximally over the left hemisphere in a rhythmic high-frequency fashion.  However, it is not clear if there is any appreciable discharge over the right hemisphere as there is too much muscle artifact and before the seizures started, the patient was eating which makes it even more difficult to localize or clearly identify a seizure onset.  The seizure lasted for the duration of approximately 1 minute, 45 seconds.  After the seizure, the patient was back to baseline.  No other seizures were seen.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to single seizure of unclear onset, likely arising from the right hemisphere and focal slowing in the right temporal region.  Clinical correlation is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizure likely arising from the right hemisphere.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region which may be due to the previous infarct.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  Epilepsy, multiple strokes in the right PCA territory.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had one episode on the morning of November 9, 2012 with impaired speech and difficulty using the left arm.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep:  In wakefulness there are sections of the record with a relatively symmetric background and subtle, if any, focal slowing in the right hemisphere.  The alpha rhythm on the right is starting to reemerge.  Subtle focal slowing is noted in the right central parietal region.   
		
Occasional wicket is noted as the patient drifts off to sleep.   
There are a number of transients noted in the transition to sleep which have a mitten like appearance, but no definite spike and wave complexes.   
At 9:10 p.m. on November 8, 2012 there is a burst of rhythmic activity from the right hemisphere.  There is no push button or clinical information to suggest that this was considered to be a seizure. 
The sleep section of the record demonstrates disrupted sleep.  There are a number of mitten-like discharges which may represent subtle, spike and wave complexes.   
Seizures:  Time 7:00 a.m.  The clinical team was aware of the seizure, but did not press the button.  By 7:00 a.m. there is some subtle activity with a bit more rhythmic slowing emanating from the right hemisphere.  By 7:06 a.m. more clear, rhythmic slowing is noted from the right hemisphere.  The physician comes in to examine the patient.  There is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact during the event.  The clinical symptoms are associated with rhythmic activity, which is relatively prolonged.  In addition, the patient is moving about quite a bit.  The activity lasts until 7:56 and then disappears.   
This discharge was associated with a clinical change in the patient's state and should be considered and epileptiform seizure.
INTERIM IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing is noted from the right, congruent with a stroke, but there was a clinical seizure at approximately 7:00 a.m., which was relatively prolonged with rhythmic activity.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old male with melanoma, mets, and status post brain surgery who presented with a generalized tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed  in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an asymmetry in the frontal central beta seen more on the right.  There is no normal posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz to 9 Hz is seen over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves and slowing are seen at T4/F8 continuously throughout the recording with associated breech.  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz are seen throughout the recording.  In addition, there is increased diffuse beta seen at times. 
SEIZURES:  At times during the recording the frontal sharp waves which appear to become more rhythmic in a pattern of 1-3 Hz and at times evolve to faster frequencies and then stop and start.  This is most consistent with small electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
Right anterior temporal sharp waves and slow waves. 
Intermittent electrographic procedures in the setting of a breech.  
Diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, with electrographic seizures arising from the right anterior temporal region.  There is also evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability, which is 
consistent with a known tumor.  These findings were communicated to the team as soon as the EEG was performed.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old male with previous left frontal resection for GBM, schizophrenia and hepatitis C, found confused on the ground on the 20th with frontal edema and a brain mass.  Status post radiation and chemotherapy in 2012.MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Cogentin INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a 40-minute EEG in a confused individual.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There are some sections of the record particularly when the patient is stimulated where the EEG demonstrates a 9 Hz alpha rhythm on the right.  There is occasionally an alpha rhythm identified on the left.  Relevant features for this EEG include continuous, arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere, maximum frontotemporal with a generous field of spread and disruption of faster frequency activity throughout the left frontocentral and frontotemporal region.  A breach rhythm was identified.  Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal fast activity were noted in the left frontocentral region with spread to the midline.   This individual had several behaviors including head turning to the left and staring.  The individual was confused throughout.   During this EEG, there appeared to have been 2 electrographic seizures without clear clinical correlate and without clear evidence of this other stereotypic behavior which was described.  The patient seemed to stare vacantly, but on 1 occasion was mumbling and squeezing fingers.  Seizure onset and offset is difficult to determine, but the discharges seemed to build up at 9:04 and again less clearly at 9:18.  Just prior to the 9:18, 9:19 discharge the epileptiform activity with paroxysmal periodic sharply contoured delta at T3 had been abating.   Ativan was given which clearly decreased both the bursts of paroxysmal fast activity in the left frontal region and the paroxysmal sharply contoured activity in the left frontotemporal region.  By the end of the EEG, occasional isolated sharp waves maximum at F3 were identified.   Heart rate 96 BPM.IMPRESSION:  1. Although seizure onset and offset were difficult to determine, this EEG does demonstrate poorly defined seizures.2. Focal slowing in the left frontocentral region.3. Left frontocentral paroxysmal fast activity.4. Sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere including T3 and F3.CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a late form of status epilepticus or a very irritative pattern.  The results were reported to the team and EEG monitoring was initiated.CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old female with Hypoglycemic and anoxic 
encephalopathy, with persistent obtundation and episodes of eye blinking. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is a brief interruption in the 
recording when the patient moves rooms. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very slow 
pattern. In this slow pattern, there are occasional generalized sharp complexes, a little 
bit more prominent in the right hemisphere. There is also a seizure which concurs after 
1 of these complexes at 13:19. Seizure onset 13:17:52 which begins with subtle, 
rhythmic activity in the right temporal region after the periodic complex and then clearly 
evolves with definitive ictal pattern at 13:18:35. The patient is lying in bed during the 
seizure. There is little in the way of an electrocardiographic correlate and the EKG lead 
is not recording during the event. The seizure ends by 13:19. No definitive clinical 
correlates are associated with it. Heart rate is 120 BPM. Because of the lack of audio 
and the lack of documentation, it is not entirely clear if the seizure was recognized by 
others or not but it was reported to the clinical team during the event. Phenobarbital was 
given for this event. 
The second seizure identified is at 20:56, is relatively brief, begins with the same right 
temporal sharp waves in a train followed by a rhythmic theta. Faster frequency activity 
emerges in but they are clearly defined repetitive activity. The event is less than 30 
seconds in duration. 
9 a.m. episode of tachycardiac. The patient is intubated at the bedside. The EEG is 
slower than it had been. Of note, in the initial recording on May 26 going into May 27, 
prior to the patient's bath and moving about, the EEG pattern was beginning to show an 
increase in theta. With the episode of tachycardia to 200, both hemispheres are 
significantly slower but much more so on the right. This pattern improves a bit by 9:34 
as the heart rate slows to the 120 range. By later in the day on May 27, there seems to 
be a waxing and waning pattern with at times a bit more faster frequency activity on the 
left. The right remains relatively suppressed. Occasional 2 or muscle artifact is 
observed. By the close of this epoch, there seems to be a clear improvement in terms of 
the activity observed. The right is not quite as slow. There is muscle artifact, occasional 
triphasic waves. 
HR: 100-200 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. 
A number of brief complex partial seizures recorded without clear clinical 
correlates. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The seizures were identified by the clinical team, 
suggesting that there were clinical correlates not otherwise described. Additional 
neurodiagnostic testing may be helpful to determine the active processes in the right 
hemisphere. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old male with epilepsy.  Patient had one event during the EEG characterized by tenseness with eyes opened, not focused, mild tremulousness of body and legs, and unable to respond to questions during the event.  The patient was somewhat confused for 1.5 minutes afterwards. 
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Norvasc, Lasix, and Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Photic stimulation is performed early on in the record.  A brief driving response is seen, but as the patient relaxes a little bit further, subtle left temporal slowing is seen.  Hyperventilation is performed subsequently and the subtle focal features can be identified.  A seizure occurred following hyperventilation and post-hyperventilation.  Post-hyperventilation, the focal slowing gradually increases 20 seconds after the onset of hyperventilation.  The seizure onset is at 14:08:37 with no clinical signs, but high amplitude spike and slow wave activity with rhythmic delta and then high amplitude delta and sharply contoured delta with a clear phase reversal at T1.  The patient starts to arouse at 14:08:57, opening his eyes and then stiffening.  He is slightly tremulous and demonstrates chewing movements.  The activity makes the transition to repetitive alpha frequency activity and then 5 Hz frequency activity by 14:09:17.  The activity begins to slow and ends at 14:09:38 for an approximate one-minute seizure duration.  The background EEG demonstrates postictal slowing in the minutes that follow, which gradually resolves.  The patient is unable to speak during the seizure and in the postictal period he nods his head from side to side.  He has a relatively lengthy postictal period including almost all the way to the end of the record.  Over time, he becomes increasingly able to speak, although initially he answers all questions with “uhm-uhm” noise.  Over time, he can answer questions, but has difficulty performing simple tasks.  
HR:  94 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal seizure, relatively well characterized by scalp EEG.
Left temporal focal slowing with rare sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Diagnostic of a partial mechanism for epilepsy. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 4-year-old male with intermittent staring spells, unresponsive to the mother for three to five seconds at a time, occurring three to five times per day.  History of asthma, otherwise normal birth and development. 
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has multiple clinical spells in wakefulness and in sleep.  These are evaluated by the tech and testing is performed to assess responsiveness. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins with the BIOCAL in the first few seconds of the EEG, high amplitude generalized spike and wave activity is seen.  The activity is seen in the first ten seconds of the EEG and occurs in wakefulness.  The recording that follows includes a somewhat drowsy pattern.  There is intermittent occipitally predominant rhythmic delta activity, which is sometimes a bit more prominent on the left than the right. 
The first well-defined seizure with seizure onset is at 13:08:26.  The child is sitting comfortably.  As is the case with the additional awake seizures, he raises his arms and does not speak.  Testing is performed.  The child speaks afterwards.  He doesn’t seem to be entirely out of it during the spells.  The EEG demonstrates a generalized, 3 to 4 Hz spike and slow wave complex.  This very first spell seems to be a bit more remarkable in the left compared to the right.  There seems to be a little sharp wave that precedes on the left prior to the generalized discharge. The tech started hyperventilation when the first event occurred.  She gives the patient a code word during the first spell and responsiveness is impaired.  During the second seizure at 13:10:06, the patient is given a color.  Once again, he is noted to just very gently raise his arms above his head.  This discharge is similar to the previous with frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity and poly spike and slow wave activity with abrupt cessation when the event is over.  This one seems to be more synchronous with fast activity seen in the frontal regions, but again has just the slightest bit of focality to the left at the onset.  The third seizure occurs at 13:14:00 following hyperventilation.  This seizure is shorter (most seizures are 20 seconds in duration, this one is 14 seconds).  He lifts his leg gently and puts it back down, but the previously described behavior was not seen with the arms.  Additional seizures including that at 13:16:06 occur when the child is asleep.  The epileptiform activity is essentially identical with a very high amplitude, at times greater than 200 msc spike and slow wave discharges.  This is bilateral, but again there is a bit more intense fast activity in the left frontal region than the right.  Following this, the patient is drowsy but not entirely asleep, although there is some stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the drowsy pattern, there is a bit of fast activity in the frontocentral regions.  The fifth seizure is at 13:18:36 with the patient drifting off to sleep.  No clinical signs are seen for this drowsy individual, but testing is not performed with the intention to let the child fall asleep.  Immediately after the discharge, a vertex wave can be seen supporting the appearance of this activity as the child drifts off to sleep.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The sixth seizure is recorded in stage II sleep at 13:22:46, ending at 13:32:56.  No clinical signs or symptoms are noted with this.  Additional, brief or less than 10 second discharges are also seen in sleep.  There are a handful of poly spike discharges noted in this sleep record, but mostly it is the longer discharges.  An additional discharge is observed at 13:27:36, which seems to slightly disrupt sleep.
Stimulation does not elicit a photoparoxysmal response.
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Spontaneous and hyperventilation-induced frontally predominant bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity.
Rare bursts of fast activity from the left frontal region in sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: On the whole, this EEG is most supportive of a primary generalized mechanism for epilepsy with frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  There are some features raising the possibility of a secondarily generalized mechanism including the left frontal activity seen at the onset of this.  This may represent the orientation of the dipole for this individual.  The seizures that occurred were relatively typical of absence seizures.  Correlation with clinical history and imaging is appropriate.  
Of note, the attending physician of record was notified during the EEG. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 61-year-old woman with a right PCA infarct with ischemia involving the anterior temporal structures with status epilepticus. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ?others, Ativan, Etomadate.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. At least in the initial portions of the record, where clinical comments are available, the patient is described as clinically seizing with involuntary movements of the left hand.  She is intubated and poorly responsive.  In the later portions of the record, clinical correlates of the seizures include subtle jerking of the left hand against the bed rail and subtle movements of the patient’s head.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG demonstrates ongoing, repetitive seizures emanating from the right hemisphere.  The seizures start as the EEG opens with sharply contoured theta frequency activity and sharp waves maximum from the right frontotemporal region with clear frequency evolution.  The seizures are approximately 45 seconds, but actual seizure onset and off set is difficult and seizures occur within a minute at the end of the first seizure.  In the more vigorous seizures, the patient has some movement of the left foot.  In some of them, there is simply tremulousness of the left.  As the recording continues, while there is no mention of a change in medications for this patient, the background becomes a bit more discontinuous and a bit more suppressed.  There is ongoing epileptiform activity, however, with fast activity and sharp waves seen in what is otherwise a somewhat suboptimal EEG from a technical perspective with some impedance artifact, ongoing epileptiform discharges and frequency evolution compatible with clinical seizures lasting approximately 45 to 60 seconds can be seen.  There is also some slight discontinuity in the record.  There is no mention of stimulation of the patient throughout the EEG.  It cannot be determined from this EEG if testing was performed.  
HR:  124 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Status epilepticus emanating from the right hemisphere.
Marked background suppression from the left.
Evidence of discontinuity towards the close of the record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is indicative of a severe form of status epilepticus.  These results might be more helpful if additional clinical information including medications were known. 
Long-Term Monitoring - December 24, 2004 to December 25, 2004
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There are no comments regarding changes in medications for this patient.  There is a comment that the patient may have renal failure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Clinically, the patient remains comatose and intubated.  Review of the video does not discern involuntary movements in association with epileptiform activity.  However, although the EEG demonstrates an intermittent burst suppression, in the portions of the EEG that are continuous the patient demonstrates seizures characterized by fast activity and sharp waves from the right hemisphere, particularly the right anterior temporal region.  The duration of the events is 45 to 100 seconds, in some cases with a brief period of suppression.  Towards the close of the record on the 25th, the EEG is more continuous, but there is ongoing sharp waves from the right hemisphere, particularly the right anterior temporal with some frequency evolution seen at that time.  At the close of the record, the EEG is no longer in burst suppression and there is more of a pattern of uniform theta.  An electrographic seizure is identified at 7:43 and the recording ends at 8:08 suggesting that the overall frequency of seizures has decreased from nearly continuous to at least hourly. 
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Ongoing status epilepticus seen at some points in the overnight recording even in the setting of a burst suppression pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If this patient has renal failure, this may have made the epileptiform activity more difficult to control.  Additional clinical history would be important to determine whether or not the discontinuity seen in portions of the record was due to medication effect or metabolic issues. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 60-year-old male with lymphoma and lifelong history of epilepsy and complex partial seizures with several complex partial seizures in the past month.  Paraparesis secondary to epidural mass. 
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Mysoline, Restoril, Primidone, Lidocaine, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This patient experienced a complex partial seizure with confusion during the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is well organized.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz, 30 to 50 V with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness, there are left temporal sharp and slow wave complexes as well as associated focal slowing.  
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and may accentuate the bursts of focal slowing and the sharp waves.  
The patient experienced a seizure at 9:49:34.  He was resting comfortably.  The first behavioral change was that he began to demonstrate restlessness.  He then had automatisms of the left hand, while looking to the right with dystonic posturing of the right.  Afterwards, he was confused.  He was speaking but the technologist had difficulty understanding him.  He tended to use more words in Spanish than in English and was semi-cooperative, but not thinking clearly.  In terms of seizure onset, there is a high amplitude sharp and slow wave complex at 9:49:44 with a burst of focal slowing four seconds later.  The first clear ictal changes began just as he starts to fidget with left temporal theta activity of approximately 4 to 5 Hz.  This is seen at 9:50:04 and evolves over the next 14 seconds.  By 9:50:14, the activity is maximum on the left, but is clearly bilaterally.  The data is reviewed with a filter on and the epileptiform activity is most intense from the left temporal region with a phase reversal at T1/T3 but with clear bilateral spread.  At 9:50:54, when the seizure is over, there is an increase in background slowing.  This starts to resolve by 9:52:26 with the reappearance of the alpha rhythm, but again there is background slowing seen in the minutes that follow.  At 9:55 the EEG seems to have returned to baseline with intermittent focal slowing and sharp waves from the left temporal region. 
HR:  70 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Complex partial seizure with somewhat challenging localization, but maximum in the left lateral temporal electrodes. 
Intermittent focal slowing from the left temporal region.
Left anterior temporal sharp and slow waves and spike and slow wave complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The clinical team was contacted with these results.  


EVENTTIME 15:09:16: The EEG demonstrates the patient’s relatively typical normal awake pattern.  The patient is holding onto the push button and telling the nurse about difficulty moving her leg.  There is some background theta from the left temporal region, but no clear epileptiform change, and the overall description of the symptoms is not like her more severe or her more mild seizures.  
EVENT TIME 15:19:47: The patient has a seven second-burst of high amplitude spike and slow wave activity from the left hemisphere.  Four seconds later, bilateral alpha activity is seen.  During the event, she is somewhat motionless and pushes the button at 15:20:08.  By the time she pushes the button, she is able to speak.  Of note, she pushes the button for a discharge lasting 15 seconds in duration.  
EVENT TIME 16:21:05: The patient is in the room with a nurse.  The EEG demonstrates an awake pattern.  At 16:28, she pulls up some yarn.  By 16:28:53, there is some rhythmic theta developing out the left hemisphere. The nurses are talking and the patient continues to knit, but she is actually not able to talk.  She is fiddling with the yarn.  She pushes the button at 16:29:09.  Of note, she pushes the button but she can’t speak to the nurses.  The EEG activity continues to build up at 16:29:16 with rhythmic theta out of this.  The patient is no longer using her hands, and the yarn is still in her lap.  Although there is an alpha rhythm, there is clear build up of rhythmic temporal activity.  The patient is sitting motionless and the nurse observes the patient in this motionless state.  The seizure appears to be ending at 16:29:45 and at 16:29:48 she lifts her head up and is interactive again.  
EVENT TIME 17:13:34:  No clear EEG change is seen. 
EVENT TIME 18:16:32: Complex partial seizure at 18:15.  The patient is awake with materials on her tray.  Initially, there is the subtle onset of theta from the left hemisphere, which is discernable by 18:16:24.  At that time, there may even be a small amount on the right.  There is clear localization to the left temporal region by 18:16:44 with rhythmic theta and delta.  This is sharply contoured. This activity is over by 18:17:24.  
EVENT TIME 19:21:09: Actual seizure onset is 19:19:50.  The patient is lying in bed and appears to be drifting off to sleep, although there is an alpha rhythm identified.  Repetitive sharply contoured delta is picked up from the left hemisphere maximum at T1 at 19:20.  This demonstrates frequency evolution over the next 20 seconds.  There is an increase in fast activity, but an ongoing underlying left temporal theta over the next 20 seconds.  The patient’s mother is rubbing her back.  The mother doesn’t appear to be aware of the seizure.  The patient pushes the button essentially after the event is over, and the event seems to be ending at 19:21:00.  
EVENT TIME 19:42:  There is a lot of muscle, but no clear EEG change.  
EVENT TIME 21:25:  The patient is awake and talking to her mother.  At 21:24, there is a small increase in theta on the left.  This is relatively subtle, and this brief burst lacks the characteristic paroxysmal nature of the patient’s more typical seizures.  
EVENT TIME  - Difficult to determine: The patient is moving about and talking.  There is the appearance of theta picked up at 21:29:10, with a clear evolution of frequency at 21:29:40 with a mixture of theta and sharply contoured delta from the left temporal region.  The seizure appears to be over by 21:31.  
EVENT TIME 22:15: There is a subtle increase in theta from the left temporal region at 21:16:20.  This seizure lacks clear or strong EEG correlates. 
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: This section of the record demonstrates sleep, unlike the initial sections of the record.  In stage II sleep, there are spindles and POSTS.  There is some shifting asymmetries in sleep, but the overall background is relatively symmetric.  There is sustained stage II sleep in this record.  There are rare right temporal sharp waves.  In comparison to other portions of the record, there are also occasional left temporal sharp waves seen in sleep independently.  In comparison to the initial portions of the record, there is less in the way of the bursts of paroxysmal fast activity from the right temporal region. 
OVERALL IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to:
	Multiple complex partial seizures identified maximum in the left temporal region. 
	More than one pattern for this patient’s left temporal seizures, some of which have a more stronger EEG signature than others, but all with the same localization.
	Independent, left greater than right temporal spike and slow wave activity.
	Intermittent bursts of fast activity from the right temporal region.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term monitoring session is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy.  


CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old male with previous surgery for a left frontal glioma now with accelerating complex partial seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, and many others.  
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient receives ____________ [to be filled in] during this recording.  He is mostly lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Complex partial seizures are identified.  The first identified is at 17:53 with the appearance of rhythmic theta frequency activity from the left frontocentral region.  Precise seizure onset is somewhat challenging.  The activity clearly shows frequency evolution with the appearance of bilateral, frontocentral rhythmic theta frequency and sharp and slow wave activity as well as faster frequency activity.  The activity gradually wanes and by 17:55:41 the seizure is more clearly over and the EEG has returned to its baseline, which includes generalized background slowing with focal slowing and breach rhythm and sharp activity in the left frontal region.  
SEIZURE, TIME 21:32 to 21:35: This seizure begins with high alpha frequency activity, maximum in the left frontocentral region.  Despite some artifacts in the background, there is clear frequency evolution of this activity as well as a spread to a bilateral pattern.  The patient is lethargic, there are no clinical signs seen during this seizure, and despite what seems to be muscle, there is no apparent movement of the patient.  
Long-Term Monitoring, 1/31/04 to 2/01/04
SEIZURE, TIME 16:57:34: The patient is in a darkened room.  The family is at the bedside.  The family notes that within 14 seconds of the seizure onset, the patient is poorly responsive and doesn’t follow commands.  This seizure has a somewhat different pattern than his usual seizures, with initially a brief burst of rhythmic, frontally predominant theta activity and then some faster frequency activity and then more prolonged arrhythmic delta from the left frontocentral regions.   
Long-Term Monitoring, 2/01/04 to 2/02/04
No seizures were noted in this portion of the record. 
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness through stage II sleep, there is ongoing focal slowing from the left frontocentral region, with a focal breach rhythm in the left frontocentral region.  In sleep, there seems to be focal fast activity, which is not necessarily spindle-like and is in the frontal region, but does not evolve.  Elements of stage I sleep include vertex waves.  
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal long-term video EEG monitoring due to:
Multiple complex partial seizures recorded with various different patterns, but all of which are localized to the left frontocentral region.
Focal slowing.
Sharp waves maximum at F3, occasional C3 and F7.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the last 24 hours of this record, no additional seizures were recorded. This EEG is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for epilepsy.

CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma, hepatic failure, heart failure, seizures characterized by generalized shaking with occasional jerking of the left shoulder, progressive unresponsiveness.  
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Ativan, Dilantin, Topamax, Topiramate, and many others.   
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is progressively unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During much of the recording, the patient is poorly responsive.  The background ranges from low voltage with a mixture of delta and theta to intermittent left temporal sharp waves. There are intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta from the left.  There are also occasional, frontally predominant triphasic waves.  
The patient has multiple practice push buttons, which are not associated with a change in the EEG.  
Through the course of the night, at 1:00 AM through 3:00 AM, the nurses identify focal jerking of the left shoulder.  This occurs at 1:10 AM, 2:19 AM, 3:02 AM, and 3:08 AM.  During the episodes with the myoclonus, particularly involving the left shoulder in this patient with a right hemiparesis, while there are no definite electrical seizures, there are triphasic waves.  
At 3:03 AM, there is another push button by the nursing staff for similar activity.  At this time, there is more delta identified from the left temporal region.  The delta is sharply contoured and is relatively prolonged.  While it doesn’t clearly evolve, it represents more delta than previously seen with a vague, poorly defined seizure onset and off set. 
At the close of the record, the EEG continues to show a slow pattern with delta activity and sharp waves, most prominent in the left temporal region, as well as occasional triphasic waves.  
HR:  90 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent left temporal sharp waves and focal slowing.
Triphasic waves.
A single, poorly defined seizure at 3:00 AM.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a metabolic process, as well as a partial or localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  The seizures that are identified by the EEG have weak clinical correlates.  


CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 20-year-old right-handed college student with refractory absence epilepsy.  
MEDICATIONS: Depakote and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Multiple push button events are identified, but not for the patient’s seizures.  In addition, the patient has multiple absence spells.  She receives Keppra (Levetiracetam) during this record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There are occasional bursts of isolated, frontally predominant symmetric high amplitude 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  The overall waking record is at the limits of normal in terms of organization for an individual of this age.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the transition to sleep, there are some briefer spike and slow wave complexes, as well as some longer bursts.  In addition, while there is no definite dyshormia, in some sections in the sleep record there is subtle sharply contoured activity in the frontal regions, but no clear asymmetry.
SEIZURES: There are multiple push buttons by the family: 17:13, 18:14, 19:19, and 20:39.  These do not appear to be seizures.  Given the language (Arabic), it is not clear what the behavior was even when reviewing the video, but these are no seizures and in some cases, when the nurse enters, the patient verbalizes in English that she is fine and that she did not experience any symptoms.
Multiple bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity are identified.  The majority of these are 8 seconds in duration.  In some cases but not in every case it is possible to identify a clinical correlate, which includes eye blinking.  The resolution of the camera does not permit identification of the facial twitching seen in the lab.  In addition, sometimes the patient scratches her scalp during the seizures.  The minute the discharge stops, the patient is back to her usual self.  She is sitting parallel rather than facing her mother and the mother never identifies these discharges.  In the initial portions of the record, they occur approximately one per hour including 4:13:46, 6:59, 18:35, 16:09, 20:07, 37:00, and 21:40.  In addition they are seen at 7:00 AM and at 10:21 AM.  There are some computer problems and a loss of data at 3:00 AM, but it appears in wakefulness in the initial portions of the record that the activity is approximately once per hour and the limited data seen on the morning of the 1st suggests that the activity has slowed to a frequency of less than one per hour.  
At 00:55:45, the patient is sleeping.  The resolution of the video is poor, but she has a burst of frontally predominant generalized activity lasting approximately three seconds followed by an arousal without clear clinical correlate.  This is one of the infrequent times that this activity can be seen.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of frontally predominant 3 to 6 Hz spike and slow wave activity, some of which are clinically significant. 
	
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background EEG is at the limits of normal.  There were no definitive frontal abnormalities, but given the refractory nature of this patient’s epilepsy, if the seizures do not improve with her current treatment plan, an additional EEG recording with special electrodes would be helpful to exclude a frontal lobe process producing this epilepsy syndrome.

There were no definitive frontal abnormalities, but given the refractory nature of this patient’s epilepsy, if the seizures do not improve with her current treatment plan, an additional EEG recording with special electrodes would be helpful to exclude a frontal lobe process producing this epilepsy syndrome. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old left handed female postpartum female with multiple seizures 
in the past day with little in the way of postictal state. Past temporal lobectomy in 2009. 
MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Keppra, Vimpat, Protonix, Lovenox, Advair, Ventolin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are 
performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm 
which is slightly slower on the left when compared to the right. There is a breech rhythm with 
amplitude activity from the left as well as some underlying theta and delta. In this sharply 
contoured record, there are occasional T3 and T5 sharp waves. The T4 sharp waves occur in 
trains. Stimulation of the patient seems to produce an increase in faster frequency activity 
bilaterally and the focal features on the left are a bit more prominent in the transition toward 
sleep. Somewhat asymptomatic vertex waves are noted and there are POSTS noted in sleep. 
The patient seems to transition in an out of sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a scant driving 
response. In some sections of the sleep recording, with vertex waves and spindles, there are 
sections with the posterior temporal sharp waves and even some left occipital sharp waves. The 
breech rhythm is quite prominent in stage II sleep and the sharp waves range from F7 all the 
way to 01. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing in the left temporal region with disruption of faster frequent activity as well as 
underlying slowing. 
2. Left temporal sharp waves which range in maximum from even the left occipital region to 
the left mid to anterior temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a broad epileptogenic zone. Additional EEG 
recording it may be helpful to capture her frequent events at this time. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 60-year-old male with a long history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and epilepsy now with subdural hematoma and recurrent seizures. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, and 6 mg of Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has an episode of facial twitching just prior to EEG initiation and another clinical episode of one minutes’ duration.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry.  Typically, the overall background is slow, but there is some alpha and theta frequency activity from the left and with arousals there is an alpha rhythm identifiable on the left.  The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity and slower arrhythmic delta activity and more of a slower, periodic complex from the right posterior quadrant.  The periodic activity is broadly formed and comes out a bit better at a slow paper speed in that the periodic discharges may be close to a second in nature with a broad distribution in the right hemisphere including the central and parietal regions.  Given the nature of the muscle activity, which occurs with the facial twitching, there isn’t a clear clinical correlate for this 60-second facial twitching with a periodic slowing from the right.  In addition, the periodic activity from the right is not at the same frequency as the facial twitching. 
This record demonstrates reactivity and variability with an intermittently more alert pattern, most remarkable from the left. 
During the EEG, the patient receives Levetiracetam and Ativan.  By the close of the record, the activity is considerably slower and the periodic activity is most remarkable in the posterior quadrant, almost with a small discrete poly spike component at P4 by the end. 
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	An electrographic seizure characterized by left facial twitching without a clear clinical correlate.
	Intrahemispheric asymmetry with intermittent, relatively prominent disruption of faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere, and a slow, periodic discharge from the right hemisphere.
	A discrete, couplet of fast activity at P4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The clinical event without a clear EEG signature is most compatible with an epilepsy partialis continua.  Overall, the background does seem to be improving following administration of medications.  Additional EEG monitoring may be warranted to make sure that the underlying epileptiform activity is abating.  


REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrent seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software including nurse's note as well as reviewing the EEG was performed though the whole 24 hours and used to further evaluate the recording.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Dilantin, Keppra.
HISTORY:  A 25-year-old man with seizure, right-sided after left brain tumor resection now with recurrent multiple seizures refractory to medications and status epilepticus.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to background that has a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz over the right hemisphere at times and is reactive to eye opening.  However, over the left hemisphere, there is no posterior dominant rhythm, no clear normal frontocentral beta seen.  The patient appears to have wakefulness and sleep stage changes with some normal sleep architecture.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Continuous focal slowing seen over the left hemisphere, maximal at T3, a frequency of 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There is a symmetric amplitude over this hemisphere compared to the rest consistent with a breach over the left hemisphere.
SEIZURES:  During the first 2 hours of the recording, there appeared to be intermittent rhythmic discharges at 1 Hz starting and stopping suddenly arising from the left occipital region maximal at 01 with some T5/ P3 component.  This are sometimes prolong, lasting for more than 40 seconds and consisting with electrographic seizures.  They were seen for about a period of 2 hours and no longer seen in the rest of the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left hemisphere focal slowing, maximal in the mid temporal region in addition to multiple electrographic seizures arising from the left occipital and parietal region occurring mainly at the beginning of the recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence multiple electrographic seizures arising from the left occipital and parietal region which improves after the first 4 hours in the morning.   In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction over the left hemisphere, maximal at the mid temporal region, which is consistent with the known tumor resection.  These findings were reported to the primary team.

MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat and Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG reveals a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is some frontal central beta seen best over the right hemisphere, at times seen over the left.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Some normal sleep architecture is seen.   
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen continuously over P3 and at times T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz.  Amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  Focal sharp waves are seen at O1 independently occasionally.   
Seizures:
The patient had during this recording 2 electrographic seizures.  The first one occurring at 7:18 p.m. until 7:28 p.m. lasting for 10 minutes.  It appears to originate at O1 with rhythmic sharp waves in the theta frequency, that increasing amplitude and frequency and appeared to spread slightly to O2 but remained mainly in the occipital region.  During the event the patient moves around but no other clear clinical features can be seen in the video.  At 12:30 a.m. the patient had another seizure lasting 5 minutes.  This time the patient again was in the bed and no clinical seizures were seen.  In the EEG there was again in O1 an electrographic seizure that began with a discharge of spikes in the alpha frequency that continued to evolve to the theta frequency and increasing amplitude and then suddenly stopped. This one was spread less through the occipital region and stayed mainly at O1.  During the rest of the night no more seizures were seen until and this EEG was reviewed until 8:00 in the morning.   
Heart rate.  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to 2 electrographic seizures arising from the left occipital region, in addition to focal slowing seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal in the parietal and temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals or is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with 2 seizures arising from the left occipital region.  In addition, there is no evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere maximum in the parietal and temporal region which may be related to the known tumor resection.  These findings were communicated to the primary team as they occurred.


DATE OF STUDY:  08/15/2013 to 08/16/2013, for a total of 24 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old man with a history of a past tumor resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and previous history of localization related epilepsy who returns with multiple seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Dilantin, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software as well as nurses' notes were all used in addition to reviewing the EEG to make this report.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record begins with a background that is slightly slow, particularly the posterior dominant rhythm appears to be mainly in the theta frequency, about 7 Hz, and it is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is some frontal beta that starts to be seen some hours into the recording which continues to improve as well as the background increases in frequency.  Some sleep architecture is seen, and state changes are noted.  No activating procedures were performed. 
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at F3/C3 as well as T5/P3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  This slowing is seen continuously throughout the recording.
Generalized slowing at 5 to 7 Hz, seen at early onset of the recording.  It appears to improve slowly throughout the lasts hours of the recording. 
Seizures:  At 10:09 p.m., there appears to be an occipital seizure commencing at O1 with intermittent theta frequency sharp waves that continue to increase in frequency and amplitude but remain over the left occipital hemisphere and continue to discharge for about 20 minutes.  During this time there appears to be no clinical correlate to the patient seen in the video. 
Heart rate 90.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a single left occipital electrographic seizure, in addition to continuous left hemispheric slowing and mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with a single electrographic seizure arising from the left occipital region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the central frontal region, which is consistent with the known tumor resection.  Lastly, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  These findings were reported continuously to the primary team.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 25-year-old man with a history of a left parieto-occipital tumor removal at the age of 12, who now presents with worsening aphasia and right hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Depakote, Vimpat, phenobarbital, clonazepam, and 8 mg of Versed total at around 12 p.m. and an extra dose of Depakote 500 mg administered at approximately 1 a.m.
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was reviewed intermittently by the attending physician during the recording epoch.  Medical staff notes and the nursing notes were reviewed.  The patient was equipped with the event button.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at high amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere consists of a low amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the right.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of 8-9 Hz activity.  There is no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the left hemisphere.  Additional theta and delta activity is observed over the left hemisphere.  Delta activity is especially pronounced anteriorly.  Degree of diffuse theta and delta increases after approximately 12 p.m.  This increase is transient, and is related to  administration of 8 mg of Versed.  A prolonged left occipital electrographic seizure is observed.  It starts at approximately 11:35 a.m. and ends at approximately 12:30 p.m.  Seizure stops after initiation of 8 mg of Versed total seizures start over the left occipital region and gradually spreads throughout the left hemisphere with reflection towards the right hemisphere.  After administration of Versed, seizure settles over the left occipital region and stays there until approximately 12:30 p.m.   Clinically seizure is characterized by decreased alertness as well as rhythmic little lateral horizontal nystagmus to the right.
FINDINGS:  
A single prolonged approximately 1 hour focal seizure that starts over the left occipital region.  Seizure stops after 8 mg of Versed.  
Mild diffuse slowing, most especially pronounced after Versed administration.  
Continuous focal moderate left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced anteriorly.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 24-hour continuous audio/video EEG monitoring due to continuous moderate left hemispheric slowing most pronounced anteriorly and a single prolonged left occipital quadrant seizure.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology and is consistent with patient's history of a prior tumor resection from the left posterior occipital region.  Slowing is also at least partially related to the postictal phenomenon.  There is an epileptogenic focus emanating from the left occipital region.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 25-year-old man with a history of a left parieto-occipital tumor removed at the age of 12, who now presents with recurrent left occipital seizures.  The patient subsequently found to have a small left occipital bleed.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Depakote and phenobarbital and 2 mg of Ativan this a.m.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed continuously.  Spike detector and seizure detector were activated.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of low amplitude beta activity admixed with theta and delta.  Delta activity is more pronounced anteriorly especially over the left hemisphere.  Additional polymorphic delta is noted over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is observed, but periods of quiescence are noted.  On 08/23/2013 between approximately 6:50 a.m. until approximately 7:59 a.m., approximately 8 electrographic seizures were observed.  They last from about 1 minute to 2-1/2 minutes.  One more seizure is observed after Ativan administration.  The seizures started with very low amplitude fast activity over the left occipital region that rapidly spread throughout the left hemisphere, decrease in frequency and increasing in amplitude.  As the seizure progresses, frequency of rhythmic activity decreases to approximately 3 Hz and gradually stops.  Clinically seizures are associated with rhythmic lateral gaze nystagmus to the right.
FINDINGS:  
Moderate diffuse background slowing.
Focal left hemispheric slowing.
Excess beta.
Multiple electrographic seizures between approximately 7:00 a.m. and 8 a.m. on 08/23/2013 that is improved with Ativan.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous audio/video EEG monitoring due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing, and multiple focal electrographic seizures that occur within 1 hour at the end of the recording epoch.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that is in this case likely related to medication effect.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction likely structural in etiology and at least partially related to postictal phenomenon.  Excessive beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines __________  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left occipital region and is consistent with a history of recent left occipital region bleed.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology primary team.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old man with history of a left cerebellar tumor resection status post chemo and radiation, and epilepsy secondary to the tumor, presents with recurrent seizures with right-sided shaking and confusion, as well as paralysis.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tylenol, Lovenox, Dilantin and clindamycin.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that can only be seen over the right hemisphere that reaches 8.5 Hz.  There is some frontocentral beta seen over the right hemisphere only.  The patient was recorded only in wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.

HEART RATE:  74.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal at T3 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  This is seen continuously throughout the recording.  At times, it becomes very monomorphic.  In addition, over the anterior electrodes, there appears to be an intermixed frontal very sharply contoured theta that appears in bursts of about 1 second, stops and starts again, occurring intermittently.

SEIZURES:  During the recording, the patient had seizures that began with his eyes turning to the right followed by a burst of head movement to the right, then his right arm became tonic and stretched tonically in front of him, followed by some dystonic posturing of the right hand and trembling while the left arm became flexed at the elbow in front of him making a sign of "4".  Afterward, the patient slowly developed clonic movements and the seizure slowly subsided as the clonic movements decreased in frequency and amplitude. Last ictal jerk was on the right arm.

EEG:  During this episode, the EEG at onset revealed the rhythmic left hemispheric slowing, but no clear onset could be ascertained for the seizure.  The seizure was quickly masked by muscle artifact and there appeared to be some prefrontal sharps in between the muscle artifact.  After the event, there appears to be focal remaining slowing over the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere appears to have almost normal theta to alpha rhythm.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures likely arising from the left frontal region, based on semiology and EEG, in addition to continuous focal slowing over the left hemisphere maximal in the mid temporal region.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures arising from the left hemisphere likely frontal region, in addition to revealing focal structural cerebral dysfunction from the left hemisphere maximal in the mid temporal region which is consistent with the known lesions.  These findings were reported to the primary team as they occurred.






CLINICAL HISTORY:  
A 25-year-old man with previous left frontal tumor removal, status post radiation and chemo, presents with recurrent seizures and right hemiparesis, now with recurrent secondary generalized tonic clonic seizures and status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tylenol, Lovenox, Dilantin, Depakote and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  
A long term EEG was performed using a standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software, as well as nurse's notes and patient's events were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  
The record overall has a right posterior dominant rhythm that can be seen over the right hemisphere that reaches 8.5 Hz, but not over the left hemisphere. There is normal beta over the right hemisphere only. Patient appears to go into different stages of sleep, but no normal sleep architecture is clearly observed. No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal slow waves are seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at T3. These can become very monomorphic and rhythmic with at times an overlying frontal theta that is very sharply contoured and appearing in bursts of one second, occurring intermittently. Overall, this pattern seems to improve by the later hours of the recording and it appears to be less monomorphic and none of that frontal theta is seen. There is some intermittent faster frequency seen at the end of the recording.
SEIZURES:  
The patient had three seizures during the recording. The first occurred at 8:44 p.m., the second one occurred at 10:30 p.m., and the last one occurred at 1:13 in the morning. Although the video was not clear on all of them, the patient first appears to turn his head to the right, with his eyes twitching in a nystagmoid fashion with a faster component towards the right, and this movement of the head is clearly versive. This is followed by right arm extension and left arm flexion and the sign of four, while afterwards generalizing and having clonic movements. The seizures usually last a minute and 40 seconds to two minutes. During all three seizures, the onset of the seizure in the EEG is not clear, as it rapidly obscured by muscle artifact, but during the seizure there appears to be some left prefrontal sharp waves seen.
IMPRESSION:  
Abnormal EEG due to three secondary generalized seizures, likely arising from the left frontal region based on semiology, in addition to left hemispheric continuous focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  
This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, now with status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising from the left hemisphere, likely frontal region, based on semiology. In addition to revealing evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the
temporal region which is consistent with a known injury. These findings were all reported to the primary team as they occurred.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This patient is a 25-year-old man with a history of left parietal tumor resection now with recurrent small hemorrhages and refractory seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Depakote, Vimpat, and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed from 8/23/2013 to 8/24/2013 for a total of 24 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and a single lead EKG electrode.   The patient was recorded while unresponsive and intubated.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in relation to nurses' notes, alarms, as well as review of the EEG as well as primary team notes was used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal slope architecture.  No normal stage changes.  There is some reactivity.  Overall there is diffuse delta background at 2-4 Hz.  During the day the patient is placed on Versed and the EEG continues to be slow but there is an overriding of beta discharge mainly in the frontal region sometimes as the electroencephalogram continues appears to be slightly more diffuse.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  The patient had a total of 7 seizures, the first 1 in this 24-hour period occurring at 11:00 in the morning.  The great majority of them lasted for a period of 2-3 minutes.  They all appeared to start with a fairly generalized alpha discharge at 11 Hz that settles more prominently at the T5/O1 electrode and then remains at the O1 electrode mainly.  Of note, there is some discharged through P3 and then continues to decrease in frequency and increasing amplitude and then slowly becomes slower voltages and small spikes are seen on the occipital region until it stops. There is postictal slowing noted heavily over the entire left hemisphere.  No clear clinical correlation was reported with these seizures specifically.
HEART RATE:  96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left occipital seizures as well as generalized swelling.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising from the left occipital hemisphere.  There is evidence of generalized diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is at least in part due to medication affect.  Please note that for the past 19 hours the patient has not had any more seizures while on a Versed drip.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.

INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed from 8/23/2013 to 8/24/2013 for a total of 24 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and a single lead EKG electrode.   The patient was recorded while unresponsive and intubated.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in relation to nurses' notes, alarms, as well as review of the EEG as well as primary team notes was used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal slope architecture.  No normal stage changes.  There is some reactivity.  Overall there is diffuse delta background at 2-4 Hz.  During the day the patient is placed on Versed and the EEG continues to be slow but there is an overriding of beta discharge mainly in the frontal region sometimes as the electroencephalogram continues appears to be slightly more diffuse.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  The patient had a total of 7 seizures, the first 1 in this 24-hour period occurring at 11:00 in the morning.  The great majority of them lasted for a period of 2-3 minutes.  They all appeared to start with a fairly generalized alpha discharge at 11 Hz that settles more prominently at the T5/O1 electrode and then remains at the O1 electrode mainly.  Of note, there is some discharged through P3 and then continues to decrease in frequency and increasing amplitude and then slowly becomes slower voltages and small spikes are seen on the occipital region until it stops. There is postictal slowing noted heavily over the entire left hemisphere.  No clear clinical correlation was reported with these seizures specifically.
HEART RATE:  96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left occipital seizures as well as generalized swelling.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising from the left occipital hemisphere.  There is evidence of generalized diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is at least in part due to medication affect.  Please note that for the past 19 hours the patient has not had any more seizures while on a Versed drip.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.


REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old man with history of alcohol abuse with new onset focal seizures with right upper extremity shaking, eyes deviating to the left.MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed from October 20, 2012 to October 22, 2012 using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG.  The patient was recorded during responsiveness.  Activating procedures were not performed.TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall there is a generalized delta with at times overriding bursts of theta bursts.  At times there is also slight diffuse attenuation. Abnormal discharges:1. Focal sharp waves seen continuously with a frontal predominance at F7/F3 that appear to move more posteriorly, more centrally, and then more posteriorly towards C3 and P3 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz rhythmically and monomorphically consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's).  2. Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.  At times there is an overriding beta that occurs infrequently and also some diffuse burst suppression for less than 1 to 2 seconds. Seizures:1. On 10/21/2012 at 9:43am and on 10/22/2012 at 4:01am there were seizures seen on the EEG with a sudden increase in frequency to a beta discharge of about 13-14 Hz maximally over the left frontal F3 electrode and C3 central electrode which continues to increase in frequency and in about a minute there appears to be an electrographic correlate, a clinical correlate, with right facial twitching.  This discharge continues for about 1-2 minutes and then suddenly stops and subsides.  It remains mainly over the left hemisphere and does not appear to spread to the right.  2. On 10/22/2012 at 8:24 a.m. the patient develops a similar rhythmic beta discharge which increases in frequency and appears to settle over the left frontal (F3) and moves centrally (C3) region, however, remaining only over the left hemisphere.  This seizures lasts about 1 minute and has no clinical correlate to it.IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left frontal central seizures, two with a focal motor correlate in the right face, as well as one electrographic, in addition to left frontal central PLED's and diffuse slowing.CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG revealed 3 left frontal central seizures, two with a focal motor correlate and one electrographic seizure, which is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of left frontal central acute structural dysfunction and irritability.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific, but maybe due at least in part to medication effect. These findings were reported to the primary team after review of the EEG.REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

No activating procedures were performed.  Overall there is a generalized delta with at times overriding bursts of theta bursts.  At times there is also slight diffuse attenuation. 
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen continuously with a frontal predominance at F7/F3 that appear to move more posteriorly, more centrally, and then more posteriorly towards C3 and P3 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz rhythmically and monomorphically consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's).  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.  At times there is an overriding beta that occurs infrequently and also some diffuse burst suppression for less than 1 to 2 seconds. 
Seizures:
On 10/21/2012 at 9:43am and on 10/22/2012 at 4:01am there were seizures seen on the EEG with a sudden increase in frequency to a beta discharge of about 13-14 Hz maximally over the left frontal F3 electrode and C3 central electrode which continues to increase in frequency and in about a minute there appears to be an electrographic correlate, a clinical correlate, with right facial twitching.  This discharge continues for about 1-2 minutes and then suddenly stops and subsides.  It remains mainly over the left hemisphere and does not appear to spread to the right.  
On 10/22/2012 at 8:24 a.m. the patient develops a similar rhythmic beta discharge which increases in frequency and appears to settle over the left frontal (F3) and moves centrally (C3) region, however, remaining only over the left hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG revealed 3 left frontal central seizures, two with a focal motor correlate and one electrographic seizure, which is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of left frontal central acute structural dysfunction and irritability.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific, but maybe due at least in part to medication effect. 
These findings were reported to the primary team after review of the EEG.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old woman transferred from an outside hospital with progressive left-sided weakness, intermittent left-sided twitching, confusion, MRSA pneumonia, multiple systemic issues, and left-sided meningioma.
		
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Vimpat, Ativan, Protonix, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The left hemisphere is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and delta.  There is generous beta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates high amplitude, arrhythmic delta activity, with periodic complexes in the right hemisphere with some variability but typically central temporal, sometimes parietal.  This activity waxes and wanes.  It has a characteristics of a PLEDS plus. 
Although there are no clinical features, this activity seems to evolve at 1:41 waxing and waning as the patient seems to drift off to sleep.  As it terminates there is a brief period of background suppression for about 1.5 seconds as it seems to be ending. 
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSIONS:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous periodic complexes in the right hemisphere with variability and waxing and waning.
At least 1 electrographic seizure in this routine bedside recording.
Marked focal slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Based on these findings, continuous EEG monitoring was initiated.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old female with a history of seizures after a stereotactic frontal craniotomy for a central neurocytoma and VP shunt, now with recurrent seizures, low Dilantin levels.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 1 gram, Ativan 12 mg, as well as added Ativan afterward; later intubated and placed on propofol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG for 18 hours was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The patient was comatose and unresponsive during the EEG.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse background which is disorganized, mainly in the delta/theta frequencies with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is also seen.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges seen at T4-T6 at a frequency of 2 Hz with amplitude of 20 to 75 microvolts.  These discharges are seen continuously but appear to evolve as described in the seizure paragraph.  During the recording, these PLEDs become more blunted and less frequent, but they are continuously seen.  At times during the last part of the recording, they appeared to have more anterior predominance, moving from T4 forward to the F8 region.
Diffuse slow waves seen in the recording. 
SEIZURES:   Frequent seizures are seen emanating from the T6-T4 electrode which evolve from PLEDs and stop.  There is a contralateral left hemisphere artifact as well as in the video left arm trembling can be seen during these seizures.  There are multiple of these occurring at the beginning of the recording, almost continuously. However, as the over time the recording improves, the periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges become more blunted and the seizures stop.  During the rest of the EEG, the last 10 hours of the EEG, there is only intermittent muscle artifact on the left hemisphere but no clear actual seizures being seen.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Frequent seizures arising from the left posterotemporal region, which later improve, and none seen during the last 10 hours.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization epilepsy arising from the right posterotemporal region, with multiple seizures seen from that region.  Please note that the seizures improve and none are seen during the last 10 hours. In addition there is continuous evidence of acute focal dysfunction and irritability in the right hemisphere.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which in this patient is likely due, at least in part, to medication affect.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegia, ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, seizure disorder, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, hydrocephalus, and a history of encephalitis, now with recurrent seizures, rule out status.
MEDICATIONS:  Narcotics, zonisamide, primidone, benzodiazepines.  Will add the rest later.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is of low amplitude consistent with delta slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of less than 20 microvolts seen continuously.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at C44/F4 seen almost continuously throughout the recording.  
Focal slow waves seen continuously at C44/F4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts with additional asymmetric increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach.
SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording, there were about 6 seizures which appeared to have an electrographic onset, sometimes at O2 and at times at C4 beginning with high-frequency beta discharge that could again start on the occipital region or the central region and increase in frequency and then in amplitude, later to slow down in frequency but increase in amplitude and would spread either from the occipital region towards the central region at C4 or from the central region to the occipital region and continue to evolve.  They would last for about 1 minute to 2 minutes.  Clinically, the patient appears to open his eyes and roll his eyes towards the right and may have some twitching of his arm and mouth movements.  The tech did question him once and he remained unresponsive.
HEART RATE:  120s between seizures and 134 while having a seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to recurrent seizures as well as right central focal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising either from the right occipital or central region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral, structural cerebral dysfunction and irritability over the right central and frontal region.  These findings were discussed with the primary team as soon as the EEG was read.  Long-term EEG will be performed.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  Reason for study:  Seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide, primidone, benzodiazepines, narcotics.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens with slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.  Overall, the background consists of low amplitude delta frequency slowing occurring continuously throughout the recording. 
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen almost continuously over the C4 and CZ while in wakefulness and sleep.  There is also some O2 sharp waves seen intermittently.  
Focal slowing at C4 CZ at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and 20-60 microvolts seen continuously when in increased amplitude compared to the left consistent with a bridged rhythm.  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz amplitude of 20-30 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording. 
Seizures:  The patient continued to have frequent seizures that appear to arise mainly at CZ4/C4 with crisp beta discharge that appears to increase in amplitude and slow down in frequency, mainly remaining over the right central frontal region.  At times there appears to be spread to the right occipital region and at times it appears to frankly originate from the right occipital region at O2.  Clinically, the patient appears to have mouth movements and eye movements.  The seizures were very frequent at the beginning of the recording and appeared to slow down towards the last hour of the recording.  At the beginning there appeared to be 2-3 seizures per hour and towards the end there appeared to be 1 seizure per hour seen in the recording.   
Heart rate:  144.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple recurrent frequent seizures arising from the right central region and/or right occipital region, in addition to focal slowing and sharp waves from that region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of status epilepticus with seizures arising from the right central region, in addition to the right occipital region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction in areas that leaded from that same region.  These findings were reported to the primary team as they occurred.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  78 year old woman status post PEA code for 40 minutes, then 6 minutes in the emergency room, now with episodes of diffuse body shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Atropine, Lasix, Lipitor, Hydralazine, Pantoprazole
REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonus.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was unresponsive during the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some sweat artifact and movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record has a diffusely slow background in between the bursts that I will describe in the next paragraph.  She has a markedly suppressed background with no clear electrocerebral activity.  However, this is in between much artifact which makes it difficult to make any clear final determinations about electrical activity.  In addition, she has bursts of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges with frontal predominant sharp waves and polyspikes that appear to at times increase in rhythmicity to a frequency of about 4-5 Hz and last for about 30-40 seconds.  During these bursts, which are usually symmetric, but at times slightly asymmetric, the patient appears to be clinically shaking and twitching and jerking.  These are consistent with myoclonic jerks.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As above.
SEIZURES:  Multiple myoclonic seizures as described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Frequent myoclonic seizures of prolonged duration in between markedly abnormal suppressed background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical injury and irritability with multiple bursts of generalized periodic discharges and associated jerks consistent with myoclonic seizures.  The interictal pattern as well as the presence of myoclonus in the setting of hypoxic injury suggests a very poor prognosis.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old female who presented to ER with sore throat felt to have epiglottitis, multiple intubation attempts failed, ended up having a PEA code with 3 rounds of epinephrine, pulse finally returned.  Circulation now about 4-6 hours later noted to have convulsive seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed drip, Dilantin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Long term digital video EEG was performed for 14 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with a 1 channel EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The study was recorded while the patient was comatose.  No activity procedures were performed.  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed and reviewed using spike detection and seizure detection software as well as nursing noted events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude diffusely slow background with frequencies mainly in the delta range.  No normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta is seen.  No sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) were seen with anterior central maximum at a frequency of 1-2 Hz.  At times this would evolve, see description of seizures below.
Generalized slow waves seen at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.   
SEIZURES:  There are multiple seizures occurring per hour seen at the beginning of the recording which originate from GPEDs which increase in frequency and amplitude in seconds and later are obscured by a rhythmic intermittent muscle artifact.  The longest of these last about 40 seconds and afterwards  the background returns to baseline.  These seizures appear to subside 4 hours into the recording and after 10:30 at night no more are seen.  After this time the GPEDs appear to become slightly blunted and lower in amplitude, although at times intermittently the morphology changes to more sharply contoured but never clearly evolve into seizures.  Later in the recording in the morning hours there is some intermittent diffuse muscle artifact but no underlying evolution of seizures or epileptiform activity could be clearly seen in between the bursts of muscle.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
Generalized seizures.  
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals multiple seizures with a generalized onset and interictal evidence of diffuse brain dysfunction and irritability.  These findings are consistent with a diffuse cortical injury and with a history of hypoxic injury.  The EEG appears to improve with time and during the last 10 hours of the recording no seizures can be clearly seen.

CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male with longstanding refractory epilepsy, now with crescendo seizures, seizure-related fall, and complaint of left-sided numbness.  
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient reports no seizures during this portion of the record. Reviewing the data, no clinical or electrographic seizures occurred.  
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  In the overnight sleep record, there are occasional left temporal spike and slow wave complexes.  No generalized epileptiform discharges are seen in the sleep record.  
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG monitoring spanned 10/11-15/06.  A single seizure was recorded on the first day of admission.  No additional seizures were recorded and unfortunately the EEG recording from the 14th through to the date of discharge on the 15th is not available.  
	
	Abnormalities included a single seizure, which began as a complex partial seizure and was not well localized by scalp EEG.  There were interictal epileptiform discharges.  In the past for this patient there have been right temporal findings and generalized spike and wave activity, but in the last piece of EEG provided, there are left temporal sharp waves suggesting a more widespread epileptogenic foci than previously recognized.  


CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed woman with a history of seizures and alcohol abuse, now with intermittent episodes of confusion and agitation, concerning for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat 50 mg b.i.d.
CONDITIONS OF RECORDING:  Digital video continuous EEG performed was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a right to left interhemispheric asymmetry.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of a low to moderate amplitude 9 to 10 Hz alpha activity with preserved anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere consists of 79 Hz activity with weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During sleep, sleep spindles and at least epoch of REM sleep is captured.  There is additional continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity over the right hemisphere, most notably over the right temporal region.  Independent right anterior temporal frontocentral epileptiform discharges and additional independent right midtemporal as well as independent right posterior quadrant/occipital epileptiform discharges are captured.  Phase reversal occurs over F8, T6, and O2 electrodes, respectively.  As the recording progresses, frequency of right occipital/right posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges increases.  A single episode concerning for an electrographic seizure is captured.  It starts at about 10:45 p.m., lasting until about 10:50 p.m.  It is characterized by rhythmic slow delta activity observed over the right hemisphere, most notably over the right temple region with embedded sharp waves over T6 and O2 electrodes.  The patient appears to wake up at the beginning of the seizure.  Also, there is an increase in the heart rate observed in a single EKG lead from about 120 beats a minute to about 130 to 140 beats a minute.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:  
Focal slowing over the right hemisphere, most notably over the right temple region.
Independent epileptiform discharges over the right anterior temporal central region, right midtemporal region, and right posterior quadrant/occipital region.  The frequency of these epileptiform discharges increases as the recording progresses.
Likely a single electrographic right hemispheric, primarily right midtemporal/right posterior quadrant electrographic seizure is captured at approximately 10:45 p.m.  This seizure lasted approximately 5 minutes.  There is an associated increase in the heart rate during the event, as well as the patient awakening at the beginning of the event.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal continuous, about 15 hour, video EEG due to:
Continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing, most notable over the right midtemporal region.
Independent right anterior frontocentral, right midtemporal, and right posterior quadrant/occipital region epileptiform discharges.
Likely a single approximately 5-minute focal right hemispheric, primarily right midtemporal/right posterior quadrant electrographic seizure.   
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   These findings indicate a significant dysfunction over the right hemisphere, likely structural in etiology with increased epileptogenic potential.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consulting team at the time of the review.


REASON FOR STUDY:  Unresponsiveness status post code.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old woman with known thyroid cancer discovered 15 years ago with progressive dysphagia who had emergency surgery remove mass.  She became acutely bradycardic.  She had CPR started and coded for about 12 minutes.  She had a change in mental status after the code.
MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, albuterol, insulin, Ancef, sodium chloride, chlorhexidine, __________, magnesium oxide, amiodarone, Tylenol, Protonix, vitamin K, Zosyn, vancomycin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was a 60 Hz artifact seen in the F1 and F2 electrodes throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There was no normal sleep architectural and no activating procedures were performed.  Overall, the background was consistent with a diffuse delta pattern at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude 20-40 microvolts.  __________ there is frontal by frontal slowing and sharp waves seen frequently throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Bifrontal and sometimes central sharp waves seen at CZ, F3 and F4, and at times at FP1 or FP2.  
Focal slowing in the bifrontal region. 
Generalized slowing as described before.
SEIZURES:  At 1:21 p.m. the EEG recording suddenly stopped and the recording restarts at 1:24 p.m.  At this point there is a clear prefrontal rhythmic discharge consistent of sharp waves maximal mainly at FP1, but at times at FP2 at a frequency of 3-4 Hz going on continuously with no clear clinical correlate.  This pattern is consistent with an electrographic seizure.  The electrographic seizure continues without stopping until about almost 19 minutes later after receiving Ativan at 1:39 p.m.  After that the EEG appears to go back to a diffusely slow background with some prefrontal slowing.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to an electrographic prefrontal maximal seizure with no clear onset seen as well as bifrontal slowing and generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals electrographic seizures which appears to be maximally in the frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal region as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but is likely related to the hypoxic injury.  These findings were discussed with the team and the patient will be placed on long-term monitoring.

DURATION OF STUDY:  Study date 03/26/2013 through 03/27/2013, for a total of 15 hours.  However, due to technical difficulties only 5 hours could be reviewed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  39-year-old woman with episode of bilateral arm stiffness and gaze deviated to the right.  Has 4-5 seizures in the past month, screaming, with a history of Lennox-Gastaut, mental retardation.  Follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, famotidine, Lovenox, topiramate, Flagyl, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to nurse's notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall, there are theta delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes which I will describe in Abnormal Discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, Fp1, Fp2, T3, and P4.  However, the spikes are mainly seen at O1 and O2 and Fp1/Fp2.  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the record, there are multiple seizures which in the EEG appear to begin suddenly and display rhythmic, sharply contoured theta intermixed with beta that at times appears to be maximal frontally and then centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  The maximal focus or origin of the seizure is unclear.  It is also atypical as it does not appear to evolve as it suddenly starts, remains in the EEG at almost this irregular but continuous frequency, and then appears to slowly dissipate.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move her head side to side and sometimes moves her arms in a wild fashion.  On 1 occasion, her mouth appeared to twitch in the video.  The duration of these episodes can be anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to prolonged 38-minute seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of multiple generalized seizures with unclear origin as well as multiple areas of irritability and structural dysfunction as well as diffuse dysfunction consistent with diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy.   
These findings were communicated to the primary team as soon as the EEG was read.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with mental retardation and Lennox-Gastaut with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, famotidine, Lovenox, topiramate, Flagyl, Depakote, and Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software was used to review the events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The EEG's multiple electrical artifact improved during the day, however, there was still some movement artifact seen throughout the recording obscuring some of the seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  Overall there are theta-delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes, which I will describe in the abnormal discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, FP1, FP2, T3, and T4.  However, the majority of the spikes are seen on O1, O2 and less so at FP1/FP2.  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  Again during the recording there are multiple seizures, about 13 of them, some of them lasting up to 30 minutes where the EEG appears to seldom display a rhythmic sharply contoured theta intermixed at beta and at times maximally frontally and centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  It is unclear where the origin of the seizure is.  It is also atypical in that it does not clearly evolve, it just suddenly starts and appears to slowly stop.  The patient appears to move her head side to side and arms moving in a wild flinging fashion.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of multiple generalized seizure of unclear origin as well as multiple areas of irritability and structural dysfunction as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with the diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.

DATE OF STUDY:  03/04/2013 through 03/05/2013.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy following right MCA infarct due to cardiac pathology as a youngster.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Tegretol, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient recalled an episode of left body tremulousness around midnight, but his attempt to push the button was unsuccessful.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively symmetric with a discernable alpha rhythm seen bilaterally and new rhythm seen on the left. 
As the patient becomes drowsy the asymmetry becomes more remarkable with more suppression of faster frequency activity on the right.  There are some sections with sharp waves noted from the right, but there are also bursts of sharply contoured slowing and sharp waves noted from the left. 
Seizures:  Although it is impossible to see the clinical event with shaking on the left in the video, there is a suggestion of rhythmic theta noted from the left T1 region around the time of the patient's description of the clinical event.   
Heart rate 66 BPM. 


CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed female with a history of tuberous sclerosis, Lupus nephritis, and brain lesions respected at age 7, with expressive aphasia at baseline.  Follow-up EEG for a history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Versed, Ativan, Heparin, Compazine, Vimpat.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video  EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was lethargic and unresponsive during the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG with no posterior dominant rhythm and no clear frontocentral beta.  Some eye movements can be seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are seen at T6-O2, at times P4, mainly in the posterior quadrant at 1 to 2 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 100 microvolts.  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz 
SEIZURES:  Although the PLEDs were continuous, they do not appear to evolve and do not appear to have a clinical correlate from the testing performed by the tech and the video.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Rhythmic right posterior quadrant PLEDs.  
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the right posterior quadrant.  There is also 
evidence of continuous focal cerebral dysfunction in this region which may be related to a focal lesion like a tumor in that region. Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specified with regards to etiology. No clear seizures were seen.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  20 year old with Noonan's syndrome, AICD, mental retardation, macrocephaly, admitted with low medication levels and recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed, Phenobarbital, Vimpat, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient has just had a prolonged generalized seizure and is quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a slow background with generous beta and arrhythmic delta.  High amplitude spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity can be identified independently from the right or left hemisphere.  On the right it tends to be maximum in the central temporal region with generous spread to the posterior regions.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted as the tracing continues and the patient's postictal period begins to resolve.  Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal.   
HR:   120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This postictal record is remarkable for:
Prominent beta activity.
Prominent background slowing.
High amplitude epileptiform activity with spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity, which is most prominent on the right.
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 12-30 – 03/11/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the overnight recording, the patient is asleep.  There are intermittent sharp waves noted from the right or left.  There is a significant amount of EKG artifact.   
At 8:55, while the patient is sleeping on his back with his pillow over him, he seems to have had an electrographic seizure without clinical correlate.  This begins with a burst of fast activity from the right hemisphere of 9.5 Hz, lasting about 5 seconds before we see irregular sharp waves which are isoelectric at T2 and T4 but with a T4 phase reversal.  This demonstrates frequent evolution and the event seems to be over in about 30 seconds.  A similar 30-second discharge is noted at 9:16 in the morning, again without clinical correlate.  The patient is tested at 9:20.  He is arousable but drifting off to sleep.  The awake EEG for him in this section of the record is remarkable for a slow background with restlessness.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old male admitted with 3 tonic-clonic seizures which began with shaking of the left arm and mouth and then went on to convulsive activity, followed by obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Keppra, benzodiazepines, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing began, the patient is in ICU and is very confused and moving about.  The background EEG is markedly abnormal with primarily a theta pattern, poorly organized with generous background beta.  In addition, there are sharp waves noted in the record with more than one localization including C3 and the right temporal region.  There is prominent theta noted in the background. 
A burst of right temporal sharp waves and delta was noted at 2:35 but without a clear clinical correlate.  This burst continues as might be anticipated in an electrographic seizure but looking at the video the patient does not appear to be doing anything other than motion arrest.  There is no significant change in the patient's behavior after this 30-second discharge.  Additional bursts of right temporal sharp waves and spikes maximum in the anterior temporal region were noted at 2:47.  At the close of the EEG, the right temporal sharp waves are building up.  They have not yet evolved into the pattern of a seizure.  Of note, the patient has turned his head to the left but testing is not performed and it is difficult to determine if there is really a change in the patient's mental status.  The patient is confused but interactive throughout the EEG. 
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:  
Marked background slowing and disorganization.  
Prominent right anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes.  
At least 1 electrographic seizure from the right temporal region.  
Sharp waves noted on occasion from the left hemisphere as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual who has had recent, repetitive seizures, this is an ongoing ictal record although it does not meet the formal criteria for a status epilepticus record and the seizure that was recorded appeared to be with little clinical signs or symptoms and was brief.   
Additional EEG recording was initiated on the evening of the 16th.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old found down, seizing. Required treatment with 
versed, phenobarbital, Ativan, and then versed drip. History of right parietal contusion 
admitted to the Trauma Service one year ago. 
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Midazolam, Dilantin, ASA, Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is 
intubated and unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low 
voltage, slow featureless pattern. When reviewed at lower sensitivities, low voltage 
beta is noted. There is an asymmetry in the delta and there is more delta in the right 
posterior quadrant. Twenty-four hours of EEG recording is provided. There is little 
clinical information documented in the record. 
As the recording begins, it is primarily a low voltage beta pattern. The focal delta is 
noted as well as some sharply contoured delta at T 4. Over time, there is an increase in 
frontal beta activity and intermittent arousal. By the afternoon, the patient's electrodes 
are sometimes a bit challenged but then are repaired by the technologist. Overall, over 
the course of the record, there is an overall improvement. 
In this intubated, comatose patient, what is likely an electrographic seizure is noted at 
4:52:32 p.m. Although there is some electrode artifact, there does seem to be some 
frequency evolution. Following the seizure, the patient is more alert. He is noted to be 
moving about. As the recording continues into the end of the 24-hour epoch, there are 
intermittent problems with the electrodes. Review of the automated seizure and spike 
detection software does not identify other electrographic seizures. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 
1. Initially a markedly suppressed pattern. 
2. A single subcritical seizure observed at 4:35:22 p.m. on the afternoon of the 9th. 
3. Occasional sharply contoured right anterior temporal delta. 
Right posterior temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related 
mechanism for epilepsy. Additional evaluation may be obtained as warranted. 
Day 2, March 9-March 10, 2011 
Demonstration of this section of the record includes a very low voltage suppressed 
pattern. Identical, left posterior quadrant delta was noted. Artifact is noted in the T2 
electrode. As the recording continues, the patient remains intubated and unresponsive. 
The tech provides a medication update: Keppra, Dilantin, midazolam, aspirin. There is 
a section of the record at 3:30a.m. with an increase in theta in the right frontotemporal 
region. At the end of the available EEG, the overall EEG is low voltage , relatively 
featureless and slow. 
OVERALL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION: This 2-day video EEG 
monitoring session was remarkable for: 
1. The findings described in the initial section. 
A single seizure in a 2-day recording.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old woman with seizure in the nursing home, lasting 1 hour, now confused with history of old left hemispheric stroke.MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, heparin.INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient is recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall the background is consistent of delta frequency slowing, which is seen maximal over the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere reveals rhythmic sharp waves and intermittent suppression, which I will discuss, and abnormal discharges.  No activating procedures were performed.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  1. Focal sharp waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere at a frequency in a periodic manner occurring at 1 Hz, maximal at F74/T3, consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's).  In between these PLED's there is suppression of faster frequencies over that hemisphere.  2. Focal slowing seen continuously over the right hemisphere at F84/T4, seen throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-5 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording there are frequent recurrent seizures arising from the right hemisphere, appearing to be maximal at T4, starting with a beta frequency discharge that appears to slow down in frequency, increase in amplitude and spread to the right hemisphere.  It appears to remain mainly over the right hemisphere and slowly subside afterwards, leaving some postictal focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region.  These discharges have no clinical correlate and are consistent with nonconvulsive seizures or electrographic seizures.  They are occurring frequently, multiple times throughout the recording and last from 30 second to 1 minute.HEART RATE:  108.IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to recurring right midtemporal electrographic seizure in relation to left anterior temporal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals electrographic nonconvulsive status epilepticus arising from the right midtemporal region.  In addition, there is focal cerebral dysfunction in that region, which may signify a structural lesion or focal irritability in that region.  In addition, there is independent focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability over the left anterior temporal region, which may also signify another focus of structural dysfunction and irritability.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.LENGTH OF RECORDING:  26 minutes.
.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of schizophrenia who presents with altered mental status and at least 2 episodes of tonic posturing with decreased responsiveness in the setting of ingesting Vicks VapoRub.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Ativan 1 mg at 6:00 a.m. and several mgs on 01/13/2013.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode with a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower wave forms observed over the left hemisphere.  The background consists of a mixture of diffuse beta, theta, and delta activity.  Additional polymorphic often sharply contoured delta is observed over the left hemisphere, primarily over the left temporal region.  Several electrographic seizures are captured in this recording.  Seizures have abrupt onset without clear localization or lateralization.  Electrographically diffuse EMG artifact is observed.  Once the EMG artifact resolves generalized sharply contoured approximately 3 Hz rhythmic delta activity is observed diffusely, but it is higher in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  This activity increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency to approximately 2 Hz and often evolves into another episode of generalized EMG artifact that obscures the recording.  Once that EMG artifact resolves, rhythmic sharply contoured 3-4 Hz delta activity is often observed over the left temple region.   
Clinically it appears that the patient moans and slobbers at the onset of seizure and has decreased responsiveness during the seizure.
FINDINGS:  
Focal status epilepticus.  
Excess beta.
Left hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the left temporal region.
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 26-minute electroencephalogram due to diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the left temporal region and multiple focal left temporal electrographic seizures without returning back to baseline.  Diffuse background slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the temporal region indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, and in this case, could partially be to related post-ictal phenomenon.  Multiple electrographic and clinical seizures captured during the recording are consistent with focal status epilepticus.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consult team at the time of the recording.


STUDY DATE:  01/14/2013 to 01/15/2013, for a total of 18 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man with CAD, schizophrenia, COPD, and cocaine use who presents with recurrent change in mental status, ingestion of Vick's VapoRub, and recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, phenobarbital, propofol, dopamine.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact in the ear (A,- A2) electrodes halfway through the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm and mainly diffuse beta continuously seen.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.  Overall there appears to be an overriding beta and background slowing underneath the diffuse beta.   
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen frequently over F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts. 
Seizures:  The patient has recurrent electrographic seizures that appear to have an unclear onset but mainly seem to develop from a beta discharge in the prefrontal region, mainly at FP1, which quickly spreads to the contralateral hemisphere and is obscured by muscle artifact.  Afterward there is diffuse delta that remains slightly more prominently over the left hemisphere until it dissipates.  The average seizure lasts about 2 minutes.  During the first recording, he was having about 5 or 6 seizures per hour.  As the time goes along, it decreases to 5, then 4 seizures per hour.  The last hour that they stopped, from 1:00 to 2:00 a.m., he has about 3 seizures.  After that there are no more seizures seen.  During the seizures, it is hard to clearly see any clear correlation in the video, but there appears to be some muscle artifact seen, noted in the EEG as described above, consistent with an EEG clinical correlate.  After 2:00 a.m., no seizures were seen.  Some burst suppression is noted, but mainly the same background remains.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple recurrent seizures of unclear onset, but possibly left prefrontal region with additional left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of status epilepticus with multiple seizures possibly arising from the left prefrontal region, which appears to have stopped by 2:00 a.m.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Lastly, the diffuse beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  There is underlying generalized slowing which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Please note that the findings on this EEG were communicated to the primary team throughout the night at intervals.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old gentleman with stroke, left MCA infarct, recurrent status epilepticus, cardiac arrest due January 22, 2012 for 9 minutes, followed by right gaze deviation with left hand shaking.  Evaluate for recurrent seizures.  Persistent obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal, Dopamine, Dobutamine, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The patient is poorly responsive and has a tracheostomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  Multiple electrographic seizures are noted with high amplitude epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere, typically maximum in the left frontal central region, but with a generous field of spread.  
The spikes seems to be maximum at C3, but fast activity is seen throughout the left frontal central region with more periodic activity left frontal.  In some locations there seems to be a posterior to anterior lag or even more than one epileptiform focus in the left temporal region, but the ictal driver seems to be in the left frontal central region.  
Seizures are typically on the duration of 1-2 minutes.  Characteristic frequency of evolution of the seizures was observed.   
Despite the marked background slowing, the patient seems to be somewhat responsive.  During the seizures, he has head turning to the right, but not really a forced deviation, more of a more gentle head turning.  
When he is not seizing, he does seem to demonstrate some head control and some spontaneous movement on the left when the seizures stop. 
The background EEG is otherwise markedly slow bilaterally.   
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A status epilepticus pattern with multiple, repetitive seizures from the left hemisphere.
Sharp waves and spikes in the left.
Intermittent burst suppressed pattern when the patient is not seizing. 
Some generalized periodic complexes observed in the interictal section of the record.
Some posterior predominant generalized periodic discharges also noted in the interictal period.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient has previously been evaluated for status epilepticus out of the left hemisphere.  This EEG may demonstrate some features which are due to anoxic encephalopathy, as well as the ictal pattern.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old male with epilepsy , diabetes, diverticulitis, fibromyalgia, childhood closed head injury. 
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Keppra, Lamictal, Phenobarbital, Haldol 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. In the initial sections of the record, The patient is started on Phenobarbital and has an Ativan drip. The Phenobarbital is started on 11:26 a.m. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a pattern with generous beta. The patient is somnolent in the early hours of the EEG and there are bursts of paroxysmal higher amplitude slowing. 
The patient is quite restless through the EEG. He has difficulty cooperating with the EEG monitoring and the electrodes are essentially uninterruptable on the morning of the 7th. 
There was a seizure reported at 3:30 in the morning. The patient remains on video camera at 3:30 in the morning. The video is reviewed. There is no evidence of a behavioral or electrographic seizure that can be identified on the video at 3:30 in the morning. 
The subsequent EEG recording on the 7th demonstrates an increase in the awake individual with a well defined alpha rhythm, generous beta. No intraictal epileptiform features are observed. Again, a well defined awake pattern is noted at 1:23 in the afternoon. 
Seizure time 4:00 p.m. 
A prolonged behavioral event is noted at 3:55p.m. with the patient rocking to the right and head turning to the right. This produces head rocking artifact in an otherwise awake individual. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not change the behavior and the patient looks away from the stimulus. 
The event is relatively long and at 4:00 p.m. the event stops abruptly and there are no postictal changes noted. Ativan was given which produced drowsiness. 
The patient is described as stiff at 4:07. The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern. Another episode of head shaking is noted at 4:35 again, without a change in the EEG. Ongoing recording demonstrates an awake and drowsy pattern. 
The behaviors recorded are most supportive of a nonepileptic process. 
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is extremely agitated, and he receives phenobarbital, Ativan, and Haldol. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is generous beta. Motor activity and behaviors were associated with an increase in muscle artifact, but no epileptiform activity. 
The patient is able to keep the EEG electrodes on, but they start to come off at 2:20. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring session was remarkable for: 
1. Multiple behavior events without EEG correlate. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The excess beta may be associated with this patient's medications. No epileptiform features were noted. 


CLINICAL HISTORY:   69 year old woman with epilepsy, admitted with small bowel obstruction, made n.p.o. with recurrent seizures starting on the 20th.
MEDICATIONS:  Midazolam, Ativan, phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is having clinical and subclinical seizures in the initial section of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, recurrent seizures typically lasting about a minute long are identified.  These are maximum at T1, FP1, and F3.  They demonstrate characteristic frequency of elution but not all are seceded with the patient's clinical event, which is clenching of both arms upward.  There is clear evolution and there is a clear pattern of a discontinuous pattern when the seizures terminate.  The background from the right hemisphere is a mixture of beta and delta.   
The patient has a low blood pressure and requires a central line and pressure support prior to the infusion of medications.  At 8:30 and at 10:00 p.m. she received 300 mg of phenobarbital, with additional 100 mg at 7:01 a.m.  This produces bradycardia.  Heart rate 48 bpm at 12:46 a.m.  The EEG does start to break up with this dose, but then a burst of sharp waves is noted at 12:47, and then a seizure 2 minutes later.   
Midazolam is initiated and titrated upward.  Epileptiform activity is seen at 5:56 a.m.  Versed reaches its maximum dose at 7:40:59.  By 7:43, the epileptiform activity is not as prominent.  There are bursts of sharp waves or fast activity from the left frontal or frontocentral region.  There are no additional clinical seizures noted.  Although there are bursts, some of which are quite prominent, none of them have the completely characteristic frequency of elution noted in the initial sections of the record.  The patient gradually receives additional doses of medications.   
The patient is maintained on Midazolam with small doses of phenobarbital.  Although there are electrographic seizures noted between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., by 19:00 hours the epileptiform activity is waning without the same discrete pattern of clearly defined seizures but more of a prominent pattern of bursts of epileptiform activity.   
HR:    48 bpm
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 11-113 – 11/21/2011 TO 11/22/2011
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
No clinical seizures were recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This section of the record is remarkable for intermittent bursts of sharply contoured activity in the left frontal and frontotemporal/centrotemporal region.  This typically occurs with a burst of delta, then fast activity and then underlying spike.  Most bursts are less than 10 seconds in duration.  There are sections of the record with bursts lasting up to 20 seconds.  There is also intermittent discontinuity.  At 7:00 p.m. is a section of the record with a bit more in the way of epileptiform activity.   
At 11:22 there is an increase in muscle noted in the background.  Rather movements of the patient's upper extremities are noted.  There are certainly sections where she seems to be coughing on the vent.  This section of the record does include prominent epileptiform activity, but no definitive seizures, particularly on the morning of November 22.   
By 2:11 in the afternoon, the EEG is better and the patient is actually moving a bit.  At that point the electrodes are discontinued briefly. 
HR:    78 bpm
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 11-113 – 11/20/2011 to 11/21/2011
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Continuous seizure and spike detection is utilized.  There is no clinical information provided in the record and there is no medication up date.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with generous beta particularly in the frontal regions.  There are sections with a discontinuous pattern, particularly at 7:00 p.m.  There are bursts of sharply contoured activity in the left frontal region or sharp waves, and some of these occur even out of the burst suppression pattern.  It appears that pharmacotherapy might have been changed at 7:00 p.m. on the night of November 22, because there is intermittently a burst suppression pattern and an increase in epileptiform activity.   
By 2:17 a.m. the background EEG is more continuous and it is more of a theta pattern.  There are also sections of the record, including at 2:00 a.m. where the camera is moved to the door and the EEG electrodes on the left are compromised.   
This section ends at 8:03 a.m. and at this point the patient is not seizing, but there is a prominent focus with left frontal sharp waves.  
HR:   N/A
LONG TERM MONITORING - # 11-113 – 11/22/2011 to 11/23/2011
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern.  There is a prominent, left frontal spike noted.  In comparison to previous sections of the record, there is significantly less in the way of bursts or buildup of the spike.  The patient is intubated and little to no motor activity is noted.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle and it does seem to produce an alerting response and perhaps even a decrease in epileptiform activity, but afterwards at 11:13 there is an increase in epileptiform activity.  
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Epileptiform activity is decreasing at the end of the LTM.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   Diagnostic of a severely refractory epilepsy.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed female with history of seizures since childhood that was recently described as left side of the body burning lasting for a second.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz only seen over the left hemisphere.  Over the right hemisphere there is attenuation of all frequencies, including beta frequency, which can only be seen over the left hemisphere.  The patient is only recorded during wakefulness.   
Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  However, during hyperventilation the patient does start complaining of left arm numbness and pain.  During this time and intermittently there appears to be a change in the EKG lead to what appears to be bigeminy for seconds intermittently.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Focal attenuation of the entire right hemisphere and disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm seen throughout the recording.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness, along with bursts of FIRDA in wakefulness.   
SEIZURES:  During the recording the patient complained of her left arm hurting, which is consistent with her typical events, but there is no EEG correlate during this event.  The patient did not loose consciousness.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Right hemisphere attenuation and disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm in that hemisphere. 
Mild generalized slowing. 
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cortical dysfunction in the right hemisphere, which is consistent with a known hemiatrophy seen on the right hemisphere for this patient.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The episodes of left arm burning did not have any EEG correlate.  However, please note that up to 75% of simple partial seizures may not be captured during scalp EEG.  Lastly, the patient did have some EKG abnormalities seen throughout the recording.  Due to this the patient was recommended to be seen in the emergency room right after the EEG.  She was taken there for this.

REASON FOR STUDY: Seizures 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old man with subdural on the right and craniotomy with EEG due to left-sided twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  At the beginning, the patient was on Dilantin and phenobarbital as well as propofol, and during the last day propofol was stopped and Versed was added.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed for 60 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurses' notes, patient events, as well as primary team's observations were used to review the EEG.  Information was given back to the primary team as it was reviewed multiple times during the day.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm which is an absent posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.  Overall, the background is diffusely attenuated and lacks normal cerebral activity.  Intermixed with this diffusely attenuated and suppressed background, there will be bursts of sharply contoured theta occurring over only the right hemisphere with intermixed sharp waves and spikes that will be described in the "abnormal discharges," that would last anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds.  There appears to be no reactivity to the EEG; however, during the first 10 hours there appears to be some muscle activity seen in the EEG which later was not noticed with the rest of the recording.   
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximal at T4, C4, and F8, seen frequently in the bursts.  
Severe generalized slowing. 
Seizures:  Throughout the entire recording, during the bursts of spike activity, clinically the primary team reported that they noticed intermittent facial twitching with each of the bursts.  These would be irregular and intermittent, at times getting worse and sometimes improving; however, there was not a clear EMG correlate on every single one of these twitches on the EEG.  There appears to be some possible electrical correlate, but it is not clear, throughout the recording.  Based on these clinical findings, the primary team would make decisions to continue sedation and antiepileptic drugs.  This occurred almost continuously throughout the recording.  On 08/11/2013, at around 4:40 p.m., facial twitches continued to be noted, and around 5:22 p.m., propofol was stopped and a Versed drip was started, which was later slowly increased up to 14 mg per hour.  During this time, the EEG remained similar with intermittent bursts, but they appeared to be slightly more attenuated and less frequent; however, still occurring.  Around 8:30 the bursts became extremely infrequent, and by 9:20 the bursts appeared to have stopped and disappeared.  The primary team was made aware of these changes, and at that time unfortunately the patient coded and there were multiple artifacts throughout the recording.  After this time, there was no clear electrical activity seen on the EEG, and the EEG was discontinued around 12:00 midnight. 
Heart rate 72. Please note that the heart rate became extremely bradycardic and disappeared for a period of time while the patient was coded.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to status epilepticus with seizures arising from the right hemisphere and marked generalized cerebral dysfunction. At the end of the record no electrical activity was seen.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising through the right hemisphere.  In addition, there is evidence of marked generalized severe cerebral dysfunction, which may be, at least in part, due to medication effect. During the last part of the record, no normal electro-cerebral activity were seen. The findings seen and reported throughout this entire recording were communicated to the primary team as they occurred with multiple reviews of the EEG over the 60 hours.

There appears to be some possible electrical correlate, but it is not clear, throughout the recording.  Based on these clinical findings, the primary team would make decisions to continue sedation and antiepileptic drugs.  This occurred almost continuously throughout the recording.  On 08/11/2013, at around 4:40 p.m., facial twitches continued to be noted, and around 5:22 p.m., propofol was stopped and a Versed drip was started, which was later slowly increased up to 14 mg per hour.  During this time, the EEG remained similar with intermittent bursts, but they appeared to be slightly more attenuated and less frequent; however, still occurring.  Around 8:30 the bursts became extremely infrequent, and by 9:20 the bursts appeared to have stopped and disappeared.  The primary team was made aware of these changes, and at that time unfortunately the patient coded and there were multiple artifacts throughout the recording.  After this time, there was no clear electrical activity seen on the EEG, and the EEG was discontinued around 12:00 midnight. 
Heart rate 72. Please note that the heart rate became extremely bradycardic and disappeared for a period of time while the patient was coded.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to status epilepticus with seizures arising from the right hemisphere and marked generalized cerebral dysfunction. At the end of the record no electrical activity was seen.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising through the right hemisphere.  In addition, there is evidence of marked generalized severe cerebral dysfunction, which may be, at least in part, due to medication effect. During the last part of the record, no normal electro-cerebral activity were seen. The findings seen and reported throughout this entire recording were communicated to the primary team as they occurred with multiple reviews of the EEG over the 60 hours.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old right handed female with a history of seizures with increased number of seizures recently, refractory to multiple medications, also with a history of nonepileptic spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lamotrigine, Zonisamide.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure classification.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term monitoring EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Video recording was also performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software along with the patient's alarms and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded in stage I and stage II and deep slow-wave sleep.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Only during sleep, some focal sharp waves were seen with a large field at FB2/F8 with small bursts seen rarely. 
DAY 1:  Two events occurred during the first day of recording.  One occurred at 1:48 p.m. and the other one occurred at 11:07 p.m.  During both of them, the patient suddenly stated that she did not feel well and suddenly started having right arm shaking and moving side to side with her eyes closed with irregular body motions and hand shaking.  During the first event, she would also lift her legs and move side to side while unresponsive.  This lasted about 2 to 3 minutes, then stopped and the patient was back to herself.  The second one was of similar clinical presentation; however, the flapping and shifting side to side was much more aggressive and severe.  This lasted about 3 minutes.  During both events, the EEG appeared to remain normal with no epileptiform activity or EEG correlate to these events. 
LONG TERM MONITORING – 12-57 – 05/09/2012 TO 05/10/2012
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Day 2:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9 Hz with a normal frontal central beta.  This patient is recorded in stage I, stage II, stage III, and REM sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During sleep, specifically stage II to III, the patient appears to have some frequent bifrontal sharp waves at FP2, as well as some more temporal sharp waves.  There is also bursts of slowing with sharply contoured activity seen with multifocal regions more frontal more temporal, but not clear if it is epileptic.   
No events were captured during this 24-hour recording.
SEIZURES:  None
This is long-term, day #3, 05/09/2012 to 05/10/2012, a total of 24 hour
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Day #3.   
Abnormal discharges:  As stated above, focal sharp waves seen intermittently in sleep with abrupt at times more prominent in the right frontal region at FP-2 and sometimes F4, and quickly moving toward the right temporal lobe.  At times there are sharp waves that appear to be left frontal, FP3, and sometimes they appear to be more at T6 P3.  These are at times all seen in complexes that last for 1 to 2 seconds, usually mainly in sleep.   
SEIZURES:  
Complex partial seizure #1.  occurred on 05/09/2012 at 12:31 p.m. and ended at 12:34 p.m., with a total duration of 2 minutes and 14 seconds.  Description of seizure:  The patient is laying on her left side while asleep.  Suddenly she arouses, opens her eyes, and jolts her body, then her right arm moves up and becomes tonic while her left hand becomes dystonic in a spooning fashion.  The right arm then continues to lower down and stretches forward along with the left arm while her eyes go back and her moans.  She then starts having clonic jerks of both arms and body.  The lower extremities cannot be visualized clearly in the video.  She continues to have clonic jerks while moaning and then slowly the jerks start decreasing in frequency and then they stop with the last ictal jerk on the left hand.  Afterward, she lays in bed unresponsive.  She is not tested during the entire seizure.   
EEG during seizure #1:  At onset, there is a generalized attenuation of faster frequencies followed by a generalized polyspike discharge that appears to be slightly more predominant over the right hemisphere than the left with no clear area of maximality, which in about 20 seconds appears to settle on the right temporal lobe more than the left and continues to evolve in frequency and then spread to the frontal region of the right hemisphere and then seen later spreading through the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere and then generalizing and obscured by muscle artifact.  At the end of the seizure there appears to be diffuse attenuation.   
Tonic-clonic seizure #2 occurred at 4:00 in the morning and ended at 4:02 in the morning.  Seizure description:  The patient again is asleep, this time laying on her right side.  The patient opens her eyes about 8 seconds into the electrographic seizure but does not move until about 30 seconds after the electrographic seizure begins.  Suddenly both hands become dystonic and stiff while stretching forward slightly, and she remains tonic with tonic stress posturing for about 20 to 30 seconds.  Afterward she starts having tonic-clonic movements of both arms while moaning repeatedly.  She continues to do this until the jerks, after increasing frequency, start decreasing in frequency and then later stop.   
EEG description:  Again, at the onset of the seizure, there appears to be a slight diffuse attenuation and slowing with no clear onset but appears to have a slight right-sided predominance, although it is mainly generalized with polyspikes that appear to be somewhat temporal and frontal maximal.  As the seizure evolves in frequency, it appears to settle slightly over the right temporal lobe, then spreading quickly to the prefrontal region bilaterally and then is obscured by muscle artifact.  At the end of the seizure, there is diffuse attenuation seen.   
SEIZURES #3:  Occurred at 06:13 in the morning and ended at 6:15 in the morning.  Seizure description:  The patient is again asleep and opens her eyes about 8 seconds into the seizure, but lays there still and about 20 seconds later her eyes rolled up and her both arms lift up in the air in a dystonic fashion, the right slightly more than the left, followed by stretching forward and both hands becoming dystonic, and then clonic movements increasing in frequency and then decreasing in frequency with associated grunting.  At the end, the last ictal jerk is seen on the left.  No testing was performed during this seizure, either. 
EEG description:  At the onset of the seizure, again there is a diffuse slowing with a sharp wave seen, appears to be slightly maximal at T6, followed by polyspikes that appear to be more posterior than anterior and maximal maybe under the right posterotemporal region at T6 which appeared to evolve and settle mainly over T4, followed by a frontal spread and then generalized spreading and obscuration by muscle artifact.  Again, at the end of the seizure, there is diffuse slowing seen.   
Day #4: 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As previous days 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  The impression is abnormal EEG due to multifocal spikes from both hemispheres, at times with right predominance but seen in both hemispheres, as well as 3 seizures with unclear onset which appear to be generalized, at times with a right frontal slight predominance.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term video monitoring unit is diagnostic of what appears to be multifocal localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the frontal and temporal regions.  In addition, the events during day 1 of recording had no EEG correlate.  As such, these events are not epileptic and are diagnostic psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  58 minutes.CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman found in asystole on 06/18/2013 upon arrival to the hospital.  The patient was down for at least 11 minutes.  Now she remains in a coma and has myoclonic jerks.  Past medical history notable for HIV, diabetes, hypertension, emphysema, hepatitis B, heart disease and drug abuse.MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include vecuronium 5 mg and Versed 2 mg were given during the study.  Precedex was stopped at 7 a.m. today on 06/19/2013.  Prior to that the patient was receiving propofol.CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Additional chin EMG lead was applied.  The recording was performed at the bedside.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  At the beginning of the recording diffuse rhythmic and semi-rhythmic muscle artifact is noted.  This artifact resolves once vecuronium is administered.  Once EMG artifact resolves, the background consists of a mixture of theta and alpha activity with brief periods of discontinuity and intermittent diffuse frontal predominant sharp waves with after going slow waves.  As the recording progresses frequency of these frontal and predominant sharp waves increases gradually.  At approximately 12:44 p.m. these discharges become more rhythmic.  There is a gradual evolution of this activity into sharply contoured 3 Hz delta activity observed over the bilateral parasagittal leads.  This activity persists without significant change for the next several minutes; however, there is gradual increase in frontal and predominant rhythmic EMG artifact and it accompanies this activity.  Clinically, frontal eyebrow twitching is noted.  This activity persists until approximately 1:02 p.m. when 2 mg of Versed is administered.  Then there is a rapid resolution of EMG and rhythmic activity and evolution of the background lower to moderate amplitude relatively monomorphic alpha activity.  As the recording progresses, there is increase in amplitude and additional theta activity is observed.  Again, bifrontal sharp waves become more prominent.  These discharges again become more rhythmic at approximately 1:25 p.m. with gradual evolution into rhythmic, approximately 3 Hz sharply contoured delta activity most pronounced over the bilateral parasagittal leads.  Since the persistent sinus tachycardia with heart rate up to 150 beats per minute is noted in a single EKG lead.FINDINGS:  1. Two prolonged, greater than 15 minutes, electrographic seizures with poor localization, most pronounced over bilateral parasagittal leads.  Second seizure occurs by the end of the recording and is not fully developed.  2. Moderate diffuse slowing.3. Bifrontal poorly formed sharp waves with after going slow waves.IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 58 minute EEG due to 2 electrographic seizures, one of which is greater than 15 minutes in duration.  Additional moderate diffuse recurrent slowing is observed.  Slowing indicates etiological nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, and in this patient is likely related to anoxic injury as well as medication affect.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team.CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old male with end-stage renal disease, multiple severe medical 
problems, intubated in the ICU, found with a blood glucose or 900. Obtundation but no clinical 
seizures. Bilateral CVA's

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10· 
20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient1s quite obtunded but has 
some cranial nerve findings. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begin s, the background EEG is markedly 
suppressed. There is a lower voltage subtle, periodic delta with a-sharp wave mixed in. This 
sharp wave is picked up at T2, T4-C4, perhaps maximum at T4-C4. Stimulation of the patient 
on 1 occasion produces a clear change in the background with rtlythmic periodic activity. In 
addition, there is some sustained periodic discharge in the right hemisphere, which seems to 
have an admixed right central temporal sharp wave. Looking at the video, it appears that the 
patient has movement of the right thoracic region In association with this. This discharge Is brief 
and subsides on its own. A second, remarkable discharge Is ldentified with sharp activity 
present bilaterally but clearly maximum in the right hemisphere. On this occasion, the video 
does not identify a clinical correlate and.this second event is without a doubt an electrographic 
seizure. In total, there are 3 well-defined electrographic seizures noted in !he record. One of 
!hem seems to be stimulus sensitive and other 2 did not have clear clinical correlates. 
HR: 120-150 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Three electrographic seizures. 
2. lnterictal pattern of marked background suppression. 
3. Epileptiform activity, which Is primarily on the right but is complex in nature. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. It 
also demonstrates a very irritative focus on the right. Ongoing EEG monitoring was requested 
to determine the patient's response to therapy.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old woman with repetitive tonic clonic seizures, obtundation, cervical cancer, alcoholic cirrhosis, HIV.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Keppra, Cipro, Benadryl, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is initially quite somnolent with bilateral decerebrate posturing and then over the course of the recording, increasingly awake.  She is awake in the early morning hours of March 9, 2012.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the initial hours of recording, the background EEG is quite slow, low voltage.  Although there is problematic muscle artifact, there are brief bursts of sharply contoured activity and/or sharp waves.  On one occasion at 11:54 the activity seems to evolve over a 30 second period, but no clinical signs are noted.   
Over the long term monitoring session, the patient is increasingly awake with more beta activity, particularly on the morning of March 9, 2012.  Despite electrode artifacts, sharply contoured slowing and/or sharp waves are noted in the right hemisphere more typically at T4, but sometimes T6 or P4.   
The final sections of the record demonstrate better quality EEG in an awake patient with what seems to be an improvement in the background slowing until the manages to take off most of her EEG electrodes.   
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hours video EEG monitoring session is remarkable for:
Generalized background slowing, improving significantly over the course of the day.
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Sharp waves from the right with technical difficulties described above, most of them are T4, but with some variability.
What is likely an electrographic seizure in the initial sections of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient had episodes of posturing.  These episodes of posturing were not associated with ictal pathology, but they did occur periodically.  In reviewing the video, no specific motor behaviors were noted with a burst of muscle activity, which may have been temporalis muscle.


History 
A 32-year-old male with severe underlying epilepsy, status post exacerbation of his seizures with multiple complex partial 
seizures today and a facial injury. 
INTRODUCTION: 
Digital Video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. The 
patient is awake and drowsy. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The background EEG is markedly abnormal. Today's EEG demonstrates excess beta, excess theta. Frequent right mid to 
posterior temporal sharp waves are observed. Although the patient is awake without clinical symptoms, he has nearly a 
pattern of electrographic seizures just prior to hyperventilation with repetitive rhythmic theta. Some of the sharp waves 
transition from mid to anterior temporal region to posterior temporal. Hyperventilation otherwise produces background 
slowing
The activity from both hemispheres is abnormal, but the activity from the right hemisphere is more significantly abnormal in 
comparison to the left. 
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and there seem to be spindles. 
During photic stimulation, he has relatively frequent right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves Photic stimulation does not 
seem to elicit seizures. 
Heart rate 100 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
Prominent electrographic pattern of sharp waves and spikes in the right hemisphere, which may include right anterior 
temporal sharp waves, repetitive rhythmic activity right occipital temporal and paroxysmal rhythmic theta. 
2. Background slowing. 
3. Superimposed focal slowing on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This pattern was identified prior to his more recent medication changes. This is one of many EEGs for this individual and the 
pattern described today is one of many seizure patterns that he has had in the past. 


CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed woman admitted with status epilepticus on August 26, 2010, previous status epilepticus. The patient says that she knows when she is having a seizure, she will feel anxious and strange. She has a right occipital infarct and a possible AVM. Symptoms typically worsens when she stops taking her seizure medications. MRI shows right MTS. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm sometimes disrupted on the right. In addition, there is some focal slowing from the right hemisphere. In wakefulness there are high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes and bursts and trains of right anterior temporal sharp waves. Testing is performed including a request for the patient to remember a word during one of these prolonged discharges, which is compatible with an electrographic seizure. The patient is able to remember a word during the discharge. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Right temporal focal slowing. 
2. Right temporal spike and slow wave complexes. 
3. Bursts of right temporal sharp waves, which at least on 2 occasions are clearly compatible with a focal epileptiform seizure, but without clear clinical correlate. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The patient is more interactive with more eyes opening when she is not having the discharges. Alternative ways of evaluating the patient may include asking the patient to look at visual information rather than verbal memory which remained intact during these events. 


REASON FOR STUDY:  Differential and classification of seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old man with a past history of drug abuse and head trauma in the 1980s who presents with refractory epilepsy here for differential and classification. 
MEDICATIONS:  During this 24 hours the patient's Keppra was held off.  A single dose of 100 mg of Topamax was given and he was on Depakote.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours using 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves were seen frequently in sleep and occasionally in wakefulness at F8/T2 much more frequently than F7/T3.
Focal slowing was seen intermittently and at times very rhythmically at F8/T2 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  At times there was also seen at F7/T3.
SEIZURES:  The first complex partial seizure occurred at 11:35 a.m.  Electrographically there appeared to be an onset with rhythmic sharp waves noted at T2 in the theta frequency that increased in amplitude and became more rhythmic as well as increasing frequency spreading throughout the right hemisphere. In about 7 seconds spread to the left temporal lobe followed by the hemisphere then slowly becoming slower in frequency into the delta range and finally being obscured by muscle artifact.  After the event there appears to be diffuse slowing throughout the recording.   
Clinically, the patient remains asleep during the entirety of the electrographic seizure but once the electrographic seizure ends, he gets up and starts fumbling with the sheets and stands up and starts fumbling with the cables.  At one point he presses the alarm and when the nurse comes he does not realize that he had pressed the button.  It is not clear if he was aware of any of the events and he was not formally tested at that moment. 
Complex partial seizure number 2 occurred at 12:13:32 a.m.  Again, occurs while the patient is asleep.  The EEG reveals a rhythmic T2 sharp wave discharge that increases in amplitude and in frequency to the theta range and becomes more rhythmic as it spreads through the right hemisphere.  About 8 seconds later it starts to spread to the left anterior temporal region out of F7/T3 and then continues to spread to the rest of the hemisphere and seconds later it is obscured by muscle artifact.  The entire seizure lasts 54 seconds.  After the electrographic seizure there is diffuse slowing seen throughout the entire EEG. 
Clinically the patient appears to be asleep throughout the electrographic seizures, however, about 6 seconds after the electrographic seizure ends, he wakes, gets up from the bed, and sits up on all 4 extremities, fumbles, and looks around, and jerks back and forth and at times side to side.  About 4 or 5 
minutes later he gets out of bed and starts pulling on the cables.  Finally he removes all the cables from his head.  The RN notices this about 10 minutes later and comes into the room where he appears to not remember what happened and thinks that he was just going to the bathroom.  He was not clinically tested either at this point.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to 2 right anterior temporal seizures in addition to bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves seen slightly more prominent on the right anterior temporal region than the left mainly in sleep.
HEART RATE:  84.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either anterior temporal lobe.  This EEG captured 2 seizures that appeared to arise from the right anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions which is nonspecific with regards to the etiology.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old male, status post cardiac arrest, now with myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Fentanyl, Valproate Acid, Vecuronium.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Status post cardiac arrest, now with myoclonus.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during unresponsiveness and comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely attenuated, or almost completely suppressed background, with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
During the recording there is intermittent bursts of anterior predominant spike and wave, as well as polyspike and wave appearing at 5 Hz in bursts that may last up to 20-30 seconds.  They appear to be mainly symmetric, but with some frontal predominance at times.  During these bursts the patient is seen on video to be having regular diffuse marked jerking of the truncal muscles associated with each one of these bursts.  This is most consistent with myoclonus.
Generalized attenuation of background. 
SEIZURES:  See myoclonus described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
myoclonus and diffuse suppression of the EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with the known hypoxic injury.  However, it is possible that the intermixed diffuse attenuation may be at least in part due to medication effect.  Lastly, the myoclonus seen after a hypoxic injury suggests a poor prognosis for significant neurological recovery.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old gentleman with a history of seizures who presented to the hospital with recurrent seizures.  He currently remains with impaired mental status, concerning for a nonconvulsive status epilepticus.MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Versa drip, Aspirin, Vancomycin, Zosyn.INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness, no clear posterior dominant rhythm or anterior to posterior frequency of the gradient is observed.  Instead, the recording consists of low amplitude fast activity admixed with underlying theta and occasional delta.  During periods of quiescence, increase in the amount of beta activity is present with bursts of brief, about 1 second, spindle-like activity.  No clear sleep architecture is identified.  At the end of the recording, with stimulation, frontally predominant rhythmic 6 to 7 Hz activity is captured.  It does not appear to evolve spatially or temporally, and there does not appear to be a correlation with a change in the exam.  This event lasts about 30 seconds and could potentially represent an electrographic seizure.  Tachycardia is captured on a single EKG lead.FINDINGS:  1. Excess beta.2. Moderate diffuse slowing.3. Possible primarily bifrontal 30-second electrographic seizure without clear clinical correlate during the period of stimulation.IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a very abnormal, about 20.02 minute EEG due to disorganized background and possible primarily bifrontal 30-second electrographic focal seizure.  These findings indicate diffuse cerebral dysfunction that in this case is partially related to medication effect, primarily from Versa drip.  A potential electrographic seizure could be a sign of an underlying focal pathology in the bifrontal regions.  The patient will be connected to long-term EEG monitoring.  These findings were discussed with the primary team.CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old gentleman with history of lung cancer and brain metastasis, who presents with altered mental status and several episodes of seizures with focality.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra, Versed.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in ICU setting using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the comatose state, initially there were right periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges with a frequency of 1-2 Hz followed be frequent electrographic seizures characterized by 5-6 Hz sharply contoured theta activity with highest voltage in right parietal and temporal region intermixed with spike and slow wave discharges with evolution into 3 Hz sharply contoured delta activity.  They were spreading to the left cerebral hemispheres.  The above mentioned seizures activity was intermixed with right PLEDs during this recording.  This pattern continued every 3-10 seconds, lasting for up to 40 seconds.  The frequency of electrographic seizure were diminished after administration of Versed.  The background activity was low and attenuated in theta and delta range.  No clinical changes are reported with these electrographic seizures.  Heart rate was 60-90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a comatose state due to:
Partial nonconvulsive status epilepticus with seizures originating from the right temporoparietal region.
Right periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.
Diffuse slowing of background activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Frequent seizures are due to the increased hyperexcitability of the underlying brain in the right cerebral hemispheres and are consistent with partial nonconvulsive status epilepticus.  Diffuse slowing of the background activity could be seen in severe toxic, metabolic, anoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to bilateral cerebral dysfunction or the effect of medications. Right hemispheric PLEDs are suggestive of underlying epileptogenicity and could be due to underlying structural lesion such as due tumor in this case.  Clinical correlation and LTM are recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old woman found down after acute onset of headache in the frontal half subarachnoid status post partial coiling of an ACOM aneurysm, postprocedure noted to have left face, arm, and leg twitching. Past medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, hypertension, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Nimodipine, Gentamicin, Dilantin, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  No activating procedures were performed, other than stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  When the patient is stimulated during the recording, there is no clear change in the wave forms.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen at F4, continuously at a frequency of 0.5 to 1 Hz, representing periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).  It is apparent that with each of these discharges, although not always consistently, there seems to be clinical correlates in the middle of left shoulder twitching.
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.   
SEIZURES:  Based on the description above, it is likely that the accompaniment of the PLEDs at F4 with the left shoulder twitching is consistent with focal motor seizures.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Right frontal PLEDs and focal motor seizures. 
Generalized slow waves with intermittent periods of attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals focal motor seizures arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology but may be partly due to medication effect or cortical injury from the subarachnoid hemorrhage.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old man with a history of epilepsy, now with prolonged generalized tonic/clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Depakote, Keppra, Phenobarbital.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Status Epilepticus
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video long-term EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as alarm and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.  There is frontocentral beta seen.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures are performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves/PLEDS at FP1 at 1 to 2 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording, although by the last 24 hours the frequency had diminished and they were only seen in some spurts with inter bursts of more than 10 seconds.  The morphology at the end of the recording was a lot more blunt and of lower amplitude.
Generalized slow waves. 
SEIZURES:  During the recording, the patient would have, at the FP1 electrode, rhythmic discharges that would increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude, and then suddenly stop multiple times per hour for the first 10 hours.  Suddenly they subsided and stopped, and for the rest of the recording none were seen.  During the ones that occurred at the beginning of the recording, no clear clinical correlation was noted.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Seizures from the left prefrontal region which subsided after the first 10 hours, and none were seen for the last 50 hours of recording.
Focal sharp waves/PLEDS seen in the left prefrontal region.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability arising from the left prefrontal region which has a high correlation with an acute structural lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of seizures arising from the same region for the first 10 hours of the recording and none seen in the next 50 hours.  There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology and is likely due, at least in part, to medication effect.  These changes were noted to the primary team during the recording.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 87 year old man with history of DVT, PE, hypertension, esophageal ulcer, angioplasty, that was found down confused by his son, now with a right frontal mass.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Haldol, Lorazepam, Hydralazine, Dexamethasone, Insulin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion and change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, but was lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow recording with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is lack of normal frontal central beta seen.  The patient is only recorded in wakefulness and no activating procedures were performed. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at C4/F4 at times in rhythmic bursts of 2 Hz consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED'S) almost continuously throughout the recording.
Focal slow waves seen at C4/F4 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-100 mV also seen continuously throughout the recording.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.  
SEIZURES:  During the recording at one point the rhythmic PLED'S appeared to increase in frequency and evolve to infrequency and decreasing amplitude for about 1 minute and 20 seconds.  In the video there does not appear to be a clinical correlate which is consistent with an electrographic seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Right frontal central PLED'S. 
One electrographic seizure. 
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals one single electrographic seizure coming from the right fronto-central region. In addition, there is evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability in the right frontal central region which is consistent with the known frontal mass.  There was also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology and may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.


LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Twenty-five minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old man who seizures since childhood, who now presents with increase in seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Depakote, and Ativan given at an outside emergency room.
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude diffuse theta admixed with occasional delta.  During sleep, the degree of delta increases.  Brief bifrontal fast activity is captured.  A single electrographic seizure is captured.  Clinically, it occurs out of sleep when the technologist wakes up the patient for hyperventilation.  During the seizure, the patient does not respond and appears to have possible right hand systemic posturing.  Electrographically, there is rapid diffuse voltage attenuation and appearance of diffuse fast activity that is most pronounced bifrontally.  The seizure lasts approximately 35-40 seconds.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:  
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.  
Occasional bifrontal brief fast activity.  
A single clinical and electrographic seizure out of wakefulness of unclear lateralization, possibly bifrontal in onset.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 25-minute awake and asleep EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing, bifrontal fast activity that is likely to be epileptiform in nature, and a single approximately 40 second seizure out of sleep of unclear lateralization, possibly frontal in onset.  Diffuse slowing indicates nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.   Epileptiform discharges and seizure indicate near cortical origin of the patient's epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology primary team at the time of the review.


REASON FOR EEG:  Refractory seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old man with a history of epilepsy since he was 5 years old, who presents noncompliant with medications and with recurrent refractory seizures.  EEG to quantify and differentiate seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Depakote, as well as Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  At about 11 p.m., the patient started becoming agitated and moving and disconnected multiple of his leads and by 1 in the morning, unfortunately the majority of his leads were lost and the recording could not be continued.  This is only a 17-hour recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at best 6-7 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient does appear to go into sleep, but the sleep architecture is not typical.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
There are rare bifrontal sharp waves seen in sleep, which appear to be maximal at possibly F4 with a prefrontal field.  
Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  Three seizures were recorded during this long-term monitoring.  The first one occurred at 10:15 in the morning.  Clinically, the patient is laying in bed and appears to grunt and suddenly jerks.  It lasts for what appears to be 20 seconds.  Electrographically at the beginning of the seizure, there is predominantly frontal beta discharge with associated attenuation that appears in both frontal regions and appears to continue as it is obscured by muscle artifact.  Afterwards, there appears to be some slowing in the frontal region.  Although the slowing is difficult to distinguish from its usual background.  The second seizure occurred at 2:41 p.m., lasting for 30 seconds.  This one occurs from sleep.  The patient suddenly moves his right arm and the right hand clearly becomes dystonic suddenly, the right arm then becomes forcefully extended, he grunts, and suddenly the seizure stops.  The nurse came into the room, but did not test him until the seizure had clinically and electrographically stopped.  Electrographically at onset there appears to be again a frontal predominant beta discharge and diffuse attenuation, which continues to evolve and then gets obscured by muscle artifact.  After the event, there appears to be some more prominent diffuse slowing.  Seizure number 3 occurs at 8:51 p.m., about 40 seconds after waking up.  The patient suddenly grunts and his right arm moves underneath the covers and cannot be seen.  This lasts about 30 seconds and then suddenly stops.  Electrographically again there is a frontal beta discharge, which is associated with diffuse attenuation and appears to continue to evolve and then no longer seen due to muscle artifact.  After the seizure appears to clinically end, there seems to be some diffuse slowing.   
Heart rate is 86.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to 3 seizures likely arising from either frontal lobe in addition to diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with 3 seizures likely arising from the frontal region with unclear lateralization.  The right arm dystonic posture in one of them suggests a possible left frontal onset, although this cannot be certain.  These seizures were communicated to the team as the EEG was performed.  Lastly, there is evidence of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 46-year-old man with history of recurrent intracranial hemorrhage, episodes of unclear etiology who now presents with new left temporal hemorrhage and multiple seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications Keppra, loaded with Dilantin, phenobarbital, and placed on Versed drip later in the recording.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  CT compatible electrodes were used.  The recording was reviewed intermittently throughout the 24 hour period by an  attending neurologist.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with lower waveforms and high amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere has a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 8-9 Hz activity with weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is additional polymorphic theta activity observed over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of approximately 8 Hz theta activity without clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Throughout the recording additional diffuse low amplitude rhythmic slow delta activity is captured.  As the recording progresses, frequency of this delta activity becomes more pronounced.  Additionally as the recording progresses the patient appears to start having poorly formed electrographic seizures emanating from the left temporal parietal region.  These seizures are characterized by rhythmic theta activity most pronounced over the left lateral leads.  As the recording progresses seizures appear to spread diffusely and are characterized by diffuse rhythmic delta activity, with associated blink artifact.  Clinically the patient appears to have a rhythmic bilateral eye blinking.  Ativan was administered but did not result in cessation of status epilepticus.  The patient was subsequently loaded with IV Dilantin.  This resulted in resolution of generalized status epilepticus; however, he continued to have focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus.  The patient was subsequently intubated at 11:52 p.m. using propofol.  This resulted in abrupt discontinuation of status epilepticus as well as diffuse burst suppression.  That lasted several minutes.  As burst suppression decreased discrete moderate amplitude sharp waves were observed over the left temporoparietal region.  Their frequency gradually increased to approximately 1 Hz.  These discharges constituted PLEDs.  These discharges are accompanied by lower amplitude fast activity thus representing PLEDs-plus.  Occasionally frequency of these discharges increases but never lasts longer than 10 seconds.  This constitutes a brief ictal rhythmic discharges (BIRDS).
FINDINGS:  Left temporal parietal seizures that slowly evolved into generalized status epilepticus.  PLEDs and PLEDs-plus emanating from the left temporal parietal region observed after 12 a.m..  Diffuse background slowing and discontinuation.  Focal left hemispheric slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous audio video electroencephalogram  monitoring due to gradual resolution of focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus that evolves into generalized status epilepticus.  __________ status epilepticus resolves with administration of Ativan and Dilantin.  However, focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus persists.  It resolves with administration of anesthetic  agent and initiation of phenobarbital.  However, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are still observed at that time.  Diffuse background slowing indicates __________ nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural etiology and in this patient is partially related to postictal phenomenon.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology primary team.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old male with posttraumatic epilepsy, HIV, profound behavioral disturbance.MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, others.INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was attempted in the neurological monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient removed his EEG electrodes within minutes of the first electrode placement and electrodes were replaced at the bedside and the patient was placed in restraints.DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  As the recording begins, the patient is awake with a pattern with generous frontal central beta, diffuse theta, and a suggestion of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are intermittent bursts of sharply contoured theta from the left temporal region. While the patient is awake and alert and not experiencing a seizure, he begins to remove his EEG electrodes at 7:17 p.m. The patient has an electrographic seizure at 7:20:08 lasting  until 7:20:36.  This is characterized by rhythmic theta from the left. Despite the problems with the electrodes, there is additional visible recording from the left temporal region through 8 o'clock and no other electrographic seizures were identified.  As the recording continues, the value of the EEG is declining because of the lack of electrodes. No additional clinical seizures were noted. Heart rate 66 BPM.IMPRESSION:  This video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for only really 1 hour of good quality data, but a brief electrographic seizure from the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Because of this patient's behavioral issues, a different strategy must be considered to monitor this patient's epilepsy.CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old male with tonic clonic seizures, history of lupus nephritis, hepatitis B, asthma.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is intermittent 6-7 Hz activity in the occipital regions, a bit more prominent from the left compared to the right. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and also seems to elicit an asymmetric hyperventilation response of a bit more rhythmic slower mixed theta delta on the left compared to the right.   
The patient reports seeing something during the EEG.  This is associated with an electrographic discharge in the left occipital region at T5, O1, and P3.  Movement, repetitive 6 Hz activity is noted in the left posterior quadrant.  It starts at brief bursts of activity lasting a few seconds and then a more sustained burst with frequency evolution is noted at 9:10:26.  That more sustained bursts demonstrates frequency evolution, slowing, and beginning to disappear by 9:11:26.  The patient is able to recall a code word given during the ictal discharge at 9:10:48.  The heart rate also increases during this event and the patient also is blinking. Photic stimulation is initiated at 9:12:29.  A brief driving response is noted bilaterally. 
HR:    70 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Electrographic seizure from the left occipital region.
Disruption of alpha rhythm on the left.
Focal hyperventilation responsive focal features on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic of a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  It may be correlated with imaging.  Additional recording is important given the presence of an occipital lobe seizure.  In comparison to previous EEG March 24, 2011 for this patient this is the first time left occipital epileptiform to be observed.


DD:06/20/2011  DT:06/20/2011


CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 40-year-old woman evaluated for new onset seizures in March, the patient admitted with tonic-clonic seizure and then was increasingly confused.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra, oxycodone, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had received Ativan in the EEG lab because of electrographic seizures associated with confusion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the initial hours of the EEG, the patient demonstrated an ongoing, ictal/postictal pattern.  As noted in the baseline EEG, the patient appeared to have a later form of status epilepticus at the beginning with periodic complexes and rhythmic epileptiform activity.  Ongoing ictal activity with clear cut, rhythmic, repetitive theta activity was noted as early as 12:18.  The activity is best reviewed in an average reference with a high amplitude, anterior temporal sharp waves, and fast activity.  Repetitive seizures are noted with waxing and waning in the right anterior temporal region maximum T2/S8.  Additional more clearly defined seizures are seen at 2:58, 3:27. 
The patient is quite restless. She has unusual behavior, but is often communicative.  In some cases, the complex partial seizures are not recognized by the family.  The patient has unusual behavior, turning to the left, ignoring the family, but the family does not seem to recognize this as epileptiform activity.  Additional ictal discharges were noted at 6:06 and 6:11.  Overall, in the initial hours, the activity seems to wax and wane from an ictal to a postictal pattern.  This activity seems to be abating by 9:29.  Unfortunately, the patient starts removing the epileptiform activity.  With the available data by 11 a.m. seems did demonstrate a reduction in the periodic complexes in the right frontotemporal and anterior temporal region. 
Unfortunately, due to the patient's behavior, there is no additional valuable data after 11 p.m. 
Heart rate: /NA.
IMPRESSION:  Day 1 of continuous EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Complex partial seizures noted in the initial hours of recording, gradually slowing by 11:00 p.m.
Ongoing confusion.
Markedly slow pattern noted from the right hemisphere with focal slowing in the periodic activity.  
More of a theta pattern on the left. 
Clinical correlation:  This EEG is diagnostic of a status epilepticus pattern, but the pattern did appear to be improving by the end of this section of the record.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of cryptococcal meningitis who remains in unexplained coma.  An EEG is performed to rule out status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, prednisone, Lovenox, metoprolol, and Protonix. The patient is not getting Versed.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single-EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of approximately 3 second bursts of variable amplitude polymorphic delta activity.  Bursts of activity are generally poorly formed over the right.  Inter-burst interval last approximately 4-7 seconds on average, thus making burst suppression ratio approximately 1:1 to 1:3.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Independent bursts of polymorphic sharply contoured fast activity are captured over the left posterior temporal/posterior quadrant.  Four electrographic seizures are captured.  These seizures all differ electrographically.  The seizures occurred at approximately 11:48 a.m., 11:51 a.m., 12:03 p.m., and 12:38, and last approximately 1 minute 39 seconds, 1 minute 23 seconds, 1 minute 15 seconds, and approximately 3 minutes and 16 seconds, respectively.  First electrographic seizure starts with moderate amplitude sharply contoured fast activity emanating from the left posterior temporal region.  This activity rapidly evolves into approximately 2.5 Hz rhythmic delta that increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency and spreads to the bilateral occipital region.   
Seizure number 2 starts over the left lateral leads either over the left posterior temporal region or left anterior temple region.  Seizure starts with a low amplitude discrete spikes with after-going slow waves that rapidly increase in frequency into the alpha range (approximately 11 Hz activity) and spread throughout the left temporal region and bilateral occipital regions.  This activity gradually decreases in frequency and increases in amplitude, and spreads throughout the left hemisphere.  By the end of the seizure, the seizure is characterized by approximately 1 Hz 0.3 second bursts of moderate amplitude, rhythmic, alpha activity.   
Seizure number 3 is similar in appearance and evolution to seizure number 2, however, it starts over the right temporal region.   
Seizure number 4 appears to start over the right anterior temporal/mid temporal region.  It starts with a 5 Hz small amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves that rapidly decrease in frequency.  As the seizure progresses it appears to stop over the right temporal region and start over the left posterior temporal region.  As the seizure progresses it is similar in appearance to seizure number 1.   
There is no clear clinical correlation with any of the patient's seizures.  There is no clear reactivity to either noxious, tactile, or verbal stimuli.  An irregular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:  
Burst suppression, with burst suppression ratio of approximately 1:1 up to 1:3.  
Near lack of clear bursts over the right temporal region.  
Four discrete electrographic seizures that differ in appearance and emanate from either left posterior temporal region, left anterior temporal region, and right anterior temporal region. 
No clear evidence of reactivity.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal nearly 24-minute coma EEG due to  1:1 to 1:3 burst suppression, poorly formed bursts over the right temporal region, and 4 discrete electrographic seizures that differ electrographically and that arise from at least 3 distinct cerebral regions.  These findings indicate significant cerebral dysfunction  and if the patient is not sedative medications indicate a poor prognosis of a full neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team at that time of the review.  The patient will be converted to the long term monitoring.


The patient was recorded while unresponsive.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, metoprolol, Protonix, Lovenox, prednisone, Lopressor, midazolam. The patient was also given Versed for a short period of time.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a background that is completely attenuated and suppressed with intermixed seizures and sharp waves which I will describe in abnormal discharges.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at T5, at times they appear to be polyspike discharges at the same electrode.  There are also sharp waves seen at T3 and F7 as well as O1 and T6 although these appear independently.  
The background appears to be completely suppressed and attenuated in between the sharp waves and the seizures.
SEIZURES:  
There are multiple electrographic seizures occurring almost continuously throughout the recording with no clinical correlate.  Some appear to occur at T5, O1, at times at T3, sometimes at T4 and T6 with polyspikes that appear to evolve and spread sometimes from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere, sometimes remain on the left occipital or right mid temporal region.  These seizures may last for 2-3 minutes and start and stop and at times there are short rhythmic runs bursts of sharp waves seen.  As described before in between the seizures there is complete attenuation of the EEG and at times intermixed with delta discharges that are sharply contoured in bursts.  Some seizures appear to terminate in the left frontal region at F7 but again sometimes they switch from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere as they evolve.  By about 8 o'clock, the background appears to attenuate and the seizure appeared to improve in amplitude and some T4 seizures are seen without lower amplitude and less polymorphic activity.  They continue to occur and appear to remain as T4 PLEDS for some time until about 8:15 p.m. after which no more electrical activity can be seen except some artifact.  At around 8:30 p.m. or slightly before, the background appears to become completely suppressed and attenuated with no clear electrocerebral activity seen and this remains for the rest of the recording.  Of note, around this time the patient was given some Versed.  The EEG then remains flat for the entirety of the recording until the next day.  During the morning the next day around 10:30, the patient was placed on an electrocerebral silence protocol and reviewed under 2 microvolts of sensitivity, there is no clear electrocerebral activity seen.  
Heart rate: 72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to nonconvulsive electrical status epilepticus arising from multiple foci with additional intermixed diffuse attenuation which progresses to complete electrocerebral silence throughout the recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this EEG the first hours reveal nonconvulsive electrographic status epilepticus arising from multiple foci as described above. In addition, there is evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction seen between the seizures which appears to progress at the end of the record to overall to electrocerebral silence.  Of note, medication was given during the process of change which may at least in part affect the findings seen on the EEG. The severe suppression was noted and informed to the primary team.


REASON FOR STUDY:  Brain tumor and seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old man with a history of brain tumor in the right frontal region status post radiation, epilepsy, hypertension and diabetes with increased seizures after surgery, now with increased seizures about twice per month, described as tonic-clonic with no loss of consciousness for 4 to 5 minutes afterwards or a bad in the mouth.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, metoprolol, metformin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Movement throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz.  The patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation that was performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously over the right hemisphere, maximal in the central parietal and temporal regions at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There is also increased beta over that region consistent with a breached rhythm.
SEIZURES:  During the recording there were about 4 seizures which appeared to begin over the right hemisphere at T4/C4 and increasing amplitude and frequency from delta to theta, and seconds later appeared to spread to the left hemisphere in the T5 electrode which appeared to continue to evolve and then suddenly stop.  During the event the patient is tested and at the time is slow to respond, but not clearly unresponsive.  The seizures last about 1 minute and 45 seconds, otherwise there is no other EEG correlate.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right central temporal and parietal continuous focal slowing and breach in addition to multiple seizures likely arising from that region
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising around the right central parietal region.  Multiple of what appeared to be possible electrographic versus complex partial seizures.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right central parietal and temporal region which is consistent with the known tumor and radiation.  These findings were informed to the patient.  He was sent to the emergency room for admission and further treatment of his seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old female with episodes of staring spells for about 2 years and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Depakote, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software as well as patient-reported events and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening and a normal frontocentral beta.  The patient reveals normal architecture of sleep.   
Seizures:  During the recording, again specifically at the early stages of the recording there is rhythmic theta to alpha rhythm that is right hemispheric predominant at times, maximal at F4, and sometimes becomes more generalized, that is continuously occurring for hours.  This pattern waxes and wanes in frequency, again going anywhere from 5 Hz to 9 Hz diffusely, but again maximally at times in the frontal region, specifically in the right hemisphere at F4.  During this pattern, the patient is tested and appears to be able to answer all questions except 3-step commands or complex math.  The patient is given a dose of Ativan 2 mg IV, which appeared to have no effect on the pattern.  Later on, the patient was given a dose of Depakote, which appeared to, about an hour later, start to have an effect on the EEG, which appeared to improve.  Overnight, actually the EEG looked much improved and normalized to a normal EEG pattern, and the rest of the recording after about 10:00 p.m. remained normal until the next day.
IMPRESSION:  Impression and conclusion we will leave for the end.  This is day #2 of recording on this patient, long-term EEG.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old with history of seizures status post code, now with seizures versus myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Trileptal, Keppra, Versed, Ativan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Twitching, seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed for 53 hours at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system and additional anterior temporal single-lead EKG electrode and bilateral arm EMG electrodes.  The patient was unresponsive during the exam.  The EEG was reviewed using continuous spike detection and seizure detection software along with nurses' notes and patient alarms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There are diffuse periods of attenuation as well as intermittent bursts of anterior maximal 8 Hz discharge that come intermittently throughout the recording.  In addition, there is asymmetric anterior predominant small amplitude polyspikes and generalized spike and waves that at times have an EMG correlate noted in the arms and in the video on the face.  It is sometimes difficult to assess if there is always a precedent generalized spike and wave or polyspike prior to the muscle artifact.  However, there are definitely times where there is muscle artifact and there is no clear spike seen on the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Polyspikes and generalized spike and waves seen asymmetrically, at times symmetrically during the recording with associated muscle artifact. 
Generalized slow waves and intermittent bursts of suppression.
SEIZURES:  As above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Markedly diffuse slow waves. 
Myoclonic jerks.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction and cortical damage, which is consistent with a known hypoxic injury.  However, some of this slowing may be due at least in part to medication effect.  The episodes of jerks associated with anterior predominant polyspike and waves are consistent with the clinical diagnosis of myoclonus.  The overall background and presence of myoclonus suggests a poor prognosis.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed female with frequent seizures noted today, movement of all extremities in addition to a history of developmental delay, anxiety, and history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Frequent seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed at the onset of the recording, hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and patient events were used to help in reviewing the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:   None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  At times there is some frontocentral beta seen diffusely.  No normal sleep architecture is seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Frequent sharp waves seen at C3, P3 with a large field.  
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  Multiple seizures were seen with an onset that appears to be at C3, P3 with a nicely well-formed low amplitude beta that rapidly spreads throughout the central region toward the right side and then diffusely.  The seizures appeared to evolve to delta and high amplitude sharp waves and then stop in about 20-30 seconds.  Clinically the patient's right arm becomes tonic followed rapidly by the left arm becoming tonic and raising up bilaterally.  The left could not be visualized during the recording.  The seizures were occurring, about 7 of them about every 2 hours.  The number and frequency started to improve at the end of the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
Frequent left parietal central tonic seizures in addition to sharp waves in that region.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with localization related epilepsy with multiple seizures seen arising from the left central parietal region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.  These findings were reported to the primary team.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Dilantin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Multiple seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software and seizure detection software were used to detect seizures.  In addition, patient events and alarms also helped in reviewing the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the night, there was some electrode misplacement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta, although there is some beta seen diffusely.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Frequent sharp waves seen at C3/P3 with a large field.
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  Multiple tonic seizures were seen where the patient suddenly lifts up her right arm followed by her left arm in a tonic fashion, lasting for 20 to 30 seconds, then stops and screams.  During this episode the EEG appears to reveal a diffuse change in attenuation that, is not clearly localizable and seen diffusely, but in about 5 to 10 seconds appears to develop into a nicely well formed low amplitude beta that is seen best at C3/P3 but rapidly is seen toward C4/P4 and diffuse frontal regions.  Afterward there is a diffuse end to the seizure.  
There appears to be diffuse delta.  The seizures to have improved in number and occur in clusters around midnight and 6:00 in the morning.  Total in average there occurred about 2 seizures per hour.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Frequent seizures of unclear origin, possibly left hemispheric in origin. 
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with likely localization-related epilepsy with multiple seizures, possibly arising from the left central parietal region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old right handed female with a history of seizures and COPD found unresponsive and pulseless.  Activity was not obtained for about 10-20 minutes and brought to the ER and found to have myoclonic jerks.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Dopamine, Amiodarone.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  
The patient was comatose during the exam and no activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely low voltage slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm and no frontocentral beta.  There was normal sleep activity seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 1-2 Hz with a voltage of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  During the recording, there are intermittent bursts of anterior predominant polyspikes that appear to evolve into theta frequency discharge lasting for about 5-7 seconds.  
During these bursts, there is notable movement of the face in the patient.  In between these bursts, the background is suppressed.  They appear to occur at least 20 times within the EEG.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Intermittent generalized spikes discharges consistent with myoclonus. 
Low amplitude generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals electrical activity consistent with generalized myoclonus, which is usually seen in post anoxic injury, as is the case in this patient.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is also likely due to anoxic injury.  This pattern usually indicates poor prognosis.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old male with hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal disease, motor vehicle accident with subsequent intracranial hemorrhage, felt short of breath and collapsed at home.  He was taken to the ER, 10 minutes of arrest on January 25, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed drip, Depakote, Heparin, Insulin, Dopamine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was unresponsive during the recording.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background which at best has a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV.  There is no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
There are generalized polyspike and spike and waves in bursts with anterior predominance seen symmetrically over both hemispheres at a frequency of 0.5-2 Hz, which have most of the correlate seen in the video.  
In between these bursts of generalized anterior predominant spike and waves, there is intermittent bursts of diffuse suppression that may last 2-3 seconds.  
Some of these generalized spike and waves and polyspikes at times become rhythmic for about 1.5 seconds, which produce a tonic response seen on video. 
SEIZURES:  Myoclonic and tonic events as described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Myoclonus, as well as a severely low amplitude. 
Generalized slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction and cortical damage which is consistent with a hypoxic injury.  The multiple myoclonic seizures seen during the recording are suggestive of a poor prognosis.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old man with hypertension, diabetes, CRD, motor vehicle accident with subsequent intracranial hemorrhage, felt shortness of breath, collapsed at home, was taken to the emergency room, 10 minutes of arrest.  Prior EEG on 01/27/2012, now in continuous myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonus.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded with no stimulation, and he was comatose during the exam.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm, frontocentral beta, or variability.  There is no activating procedures.  During the recording there are diffuse bursts of attenuation intermixed with infrequent bursts of, at times, generalized polyspike seen maximal anterior and spike and wave that sometimes can be seen prior to EMG muscle correlate and sometimes are not seen before EMG muscle correlate, which on video is consistent with myoclonus and twitching of the lower extremities.  During the exam, the patient is stimulated with noxious stimuli, variable, and sound stimuli, and there is no improvement of the EEG frequencies.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Polyspike discharges with associated muscle activity consistent with myoclonus.
Generalized slowing at 2 to 4 Hz with microvolts of 20 to 40 microvolts amplitude with intermittent burst suppression and attenuation in the background. 
SEIZURES:  See above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Myoclonus.
Severely slow and attenuated background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability consistent with myoclonus.  These findings are suggestive of poor prognosis, especially in the setting of hypoxic brain injury.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old man status post PEA code for 15 minutes, found down for some unknown period of time.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Zosyn, Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Midazolam, Fentanyl, Versed.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Status post PEA code, found down.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely suppressed background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  Intermixed with this diffuse attenuation, there are bursts of at times frontally predominant spike discharge followed by muscle artifact.  At times this frontally predominant spike is not seen but there is slowing and muscle artifact.  Clinically, the patient appears to open his eyes during these burst that last as long as 2 seconds and appears to tremble slightly.  The patient is suctioned during the study and there is no change in the pattern in the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Diffuse suppression.
Bursts of anterior predominant spike and slow wave discharge followed by slow waves and muscle artifact along with associated clinical response of eye opening and trembling consistent with myoclonus.
SEIZURES:  See above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Generalized suppression and generalized spike and wave discharges consistent with myoclonus.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with the known hypoxic injury.  The marked suppression pattern along with the myoclonus is suggestive of a poor prognosis.


CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman with an episode a month ago of loss of consciousness with confusion, has occurred 2 times per week, has significant hypertension, COPD, aneurysm, asthma, infarction, and history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Lopressor, Norvasc, Remeron, also supposed to be taking Keppra, unfortunately in the last note from the doctor, appears that she was noncompliant.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at 10-11 Hz seen mainly over the left hemisphere and somewhat attenuated and interrupted over the left hemisphere.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded only in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at T6, sometimes at C4/P4.  
Focal slow waves seen continuously over the right hemisphere, maximum over the anterior temporal region at F8/T4, but sometimes more at C4/F4.
Rhythmic run of C4 sharp wave with some evolution.
SEIZURES:  There were 4 seizures that began at electrode T6 with evolving low amplitude beta frequency that decreases in frequency, but increases in amplitude and evolves to sharp waves and spreads to the right occipital region and right parietal quadrant, then stops suddenly.  The seizures last anywhere from 1 minute to 2 minutes.  During the events, there appears to be no clinical correlate and during one of them, the technician asks the patient to count backwards while it is occurring and the patient is able to perform the command with no difficulty.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
4 electrographic right posterotemporal seizures.  
Right hemispheric slowing maximally in the anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures arising from the right posterotemporal and central region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the right hemisphere, maximal in the anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known stroke.  The findings in the EEG were communicated to her primary care doctor and multiple calls were made to the patient to make her aware of her diagnosis.  However, no answer was obtained.


CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old man with a history of hypertension and epilepsy, the last one occurring yesterday.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Hydrochlorothiazide.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and since lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/D3 and at times T3 occasionally at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  During the EEG recording, the patient reports feeling his normal aura of smell of ammonia.  During that time, the EEG remained unremarkable with no changes.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Left anterior temporal and mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal and mid temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The episode of where the patient report smelling “ammonia” that was captured, had no EEG correlate.  As such, it may represent simple partial seizure which up to 75% of the time has no EEG correlate.  No clear seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.


REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 18-year-old woman with a history of seizures since age 2, seizure free until age 10, began to have seizures during sleep every night.  Reports tongue biting, bladder incontinence, and no recall of events.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed including photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The records reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep. 
Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation. 
Abnormal discharges:
Frequent focal sharp waves seen at F7/T4 at times with a more posterior component at T6 and sometimes more of anterior component at FP2.  These occurred frequently during wakefulness and sleep. 
Focal sharp waves seen rarely at F7/T3 during wakefulness and sleep. 
Seizures:  One seizure occurred at 9:48:10 a.m. where the patient suddenly while asleep opened her eyes and appears to be startled.  She moves her eyes to the right and turns her head to the right and starts moaning.  Next, her right arm starts shaking back and forth and she continues to do this for some seconds until her shoulders start shaking and then she starts shaking the left arm.  Next, the head moves to the left and then she starts moving side to side while moaning.  At this point the left hand appears to be having some automatisms and she starts arching her back until the seizure ends. 
Electrographically at the onset of the seizure there appeared to be a bilateral prefrontal discharge which only causes the left hemisphere to become attenuated and muscle artifact starts forming.  At that point central alpha discharge is noticed, specifically a CZ, which then involves into a diffuse theta and delta slowing seen in both hemispheres.  As the patient's head moves side to side, the rhythmicity continues to evolve and suddenly stops.  Afterwards there is diffuse slowing. 
Heart rate:  108.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right, much more than left, anterior temporal sharp waves and a single seizure of unclear onset, but appears to be possibly left prefrontal with quick spread centrally.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either anterior temporal lobe or the frontal lobe.


CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old right handed male admitted to Nursing Facility due to Dilantin toxicity who presented yesterday to the Outpatient Neurology Clinic with report of 3 seizures and proceeded to have complex partial seizures in the office with a return to the baseline, now admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for complex partial status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Tylenol.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out status.
INTRODUCTION:  Long-term digital video EEG was performed at bedside for 12 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system and additional anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  Seizure spike detection software was used along with nursing reports of events and review of the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  At the onset of the EEG, there was an increased amount of movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the onset of record, the background appeared to be mildly slow with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz but appears to be reactive to eye opening and closing.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Patient during the recording does go into the first stages of sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  In the recording, there are, specifically at the beginning, frequent focal sharp waves seen at T4/T6, at times moving more anteriorly to T2/F8.  In addition, there are infrequent O2 sharp waves and T1/F7 sharp waves are also seen.  The sharp waves at times appear to become rhythmic without evolution, specifically the ones on the T2/T6 electrode.
SEIZURES:  Multiple seizures were seen at the beginning of the recording that appeared to be arising mainly from the right temporal region, specifically at the T4/T6 electrodes.  However, sometimes the seizures appeared to start or spike quickly to the left temporal region and it is difficult or unclear to note the onset.  At times, they also appeared to ping-pong from the right to the left hemisphere in the temporal region before stopping and starting.  The patient appeared to move around in bed, sometimes rhythmically  moving the right hand during the events and staring, but if talked to, would be able to answer questions simply.  After about 10:50 p.m. the seizures subsided and only about 3 of them were seen which were all arising from the right temporal region.  The last one was noted this morning around the end of the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Right more than left temporal lobe seizures. 
Right temporal sharp waves. 
Right posterior temporal occipital sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term EEG revealed evidence of partial status epilepticus arising from the temporal lobes.  The seizures, however, subsequently markedly reduced in number after two hours into the recording.  In addition, there was evidence of bitemporal focal cerebral dysfunction and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.


REASON FOR STUDY: Rule out seizures. 
HISTORY: A 57-year-old woman with recent onset of staring spells for about 2 days lasting for 30 seconds. These spells have consisted o f mainly left sided gaze deviation. The patient also has a history of breast cancer and HIV. 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None. 
MEDICATIONS: Methadone, Protonix, lovenox, and azithromycin. 
INTRODUCTION: A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded while confused and drowsy. Activating procedures were not performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens up to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 5 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye-opening. There IS some frontocentral beta seen. The patient is recorded mainly In wakefulness and drowsiness. Activating procedures were not performed. 
DISCHARGES: Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz seen throughout the recording at times with intermixed delta. 
SEIZURES: During the recording there were 3 seizures seen. On the EEG there appears to be right frontal. Specifically at F4, theta discharge that appears to spread throughout the right central and right frontal regions and continues to increase In amplitude and decrease in frequency remaining mainly over the right hemisphere. As the seizure continues it slows down in frequency to a high amplitude delta sharp waves that are maximal at F4. The seizures last for about 1 minute. Clinically. The patient appears to lift up the head and look towards the left. It is not clear if she is unresponsive throughout the event as there is no good audio on the video for the EEG. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due lo 3 seizures arising from the right frontal region in addition to moderate diffuse slowing.
 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with 3 seizures arising from the right frontal region. In addition, there is evidence of mild to moderate diffuse which IS nonspecific with regards to etiology. These findings were reported to the as they were seen. 


REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old woman with a history of seizures, hepatitis C, drug abuse on methadone, who presents with complaints of heart racing, dizzy, feeling shaky with no loss of consciousness.  She has had seizures for 9 years, last one was 1 week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, aspirin, Lovenox, gabapentin, zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with a lead anterior temporal and a single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact intermittently.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges.  Throughout the recording, the patient has intermittent bouts of nystagmoid eye movements while her eyes are closed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal sharp wave seen at 01 intermittently, in addition to focal slowing seen at also 01-02 in the parietal region at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  The patient had a seizure at 1:19:46 p.m. which clinically the patient appears to move her head to the left and then to the right.  Then suddenly her eyes deviate towards the right and her head starts turning towards the right while her hands are clenched in front of her.  She remains in a stiff posturing with her eyes deviated to the right and her head deviated to the right throughout the entire seizure.  She intermittently swallows while this is occurring and smacks her lips.  It appears that at 1:21:20, the seizure ends electrographically, however, clinically she continues to stare and appears to continue to lip smack and mumbles.  The patient remains confused until almost the end of the recording.
EEG:  It appears the electrographic onset to be a sudden change in attenuation over the right hemisphere, losing the posterior dominant frequency.  This continues to evolve with frontal theta discharge that appears as the patient starts moving her head to the right, then spreads to the occipital region on the left hemisphere.  It continues to quickly increase and evolve amplitude and decrease in frequency until it is obscured by muscle artifact.  There is a buildup and spread of this rhythmicity and which suddenly it stops and is followed by diffuse slowing with intermixed muscle artifact on the EEG.   
Heart rate 84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a single seizure, of unclear origin, in addition to some left occipital sharp waves and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with a single seizure of unclear origin. In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction and irritability in the left occipital area.
