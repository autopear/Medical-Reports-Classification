clinic histori this is 26-year-old male who present with increas seizur frequenc in januari histori of complex partial seizur start in his earli 20s patient father also has similar histori of seizur but is well control medic keppra topamax and dilantin keppra was stop on the first day of this patient long-term monitor and zonisamid was initi at small dose introduct digit video eeg is perform in the long-term eeg monitor unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg no push button event or seizur episod were report descript of the record in wake the background eeg is symmetr there is 10 hz 30 uv posterior domin rhythm and small amount of low voltag frontocentr beta activ at time burst of general activ sometim start in the left or right hemispher were observ sometim the burst of general activ start in the frontal area but most often in the t5 and o1 area the burst activ includ sharp and slow wave sharpli contour activ or rhythmic-lik period sharp and slow wave activ occasion fast rhythmic delta activ was seen in the frontal region some sharp wave were also seen in the f4 area no clinic seizur were correl event no push button were press and no clinic seizur were record long-term monitor 10 04 to 11 04 introduct digit video eeg continu in the long-term eeg monitor unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg hyperventil and photic stimul were not perform this is an awak and asleep record descript of the record in wake the background eeg is symmetr there is 10 hz 30 uv posterior domin rhythm and small amount of low voltag frontocentr beta activ at time burst activ last two to three second start at t5 and o1 and sometim at fp2 and f4 were observ occasion fast activ togeth with rhythmic delta activ is seen in the frontal region the burst activ is general or altern start from the left or right hemispher sleep is evidenc of slow roll eye movement vertex wave and spindl no clinic seizur were correl event at 15 05 27 the patient is lie on the bed and talk with the nurs initi he respond normal but then stop talk and kept quiet the nurs did not realiz that the patient was have seizur but the eeg demonstr sharp and slow wave start from the left central and tempor area and general the general sharp and slow wave activ becam rhythmic or period the patient stay in the bed quiet and with some postur such as shift his head to look left or right and pretend to dri his hand twice most often he sat quiet in bed and turn his head to the right the background continu to have period slow burst of about two to four second the eeg return back to baselin at 15 08 37 at that time the patient still seem to be confus becaus he did not answer question and just look at the nurs long-term monitor 11 04 to 12 04 introduct digit video eeg continu in the long-term eeg monitor unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg hyperventil and photic stimul were not perform descript of the record in wake the background eeg is symmetr there is 10 hz 30 uv posterior domin rhythm and small amount of low voltag frontocentr beta activ burst of general activ sometim origin from the left or right hemispher were observ at time the burst activ start from the right hemispher but at other time can start in the left hemispher sleep is evidenc of slow roll eye movement mixtur of brain wave frequenc vertex wave and spindl event one event was detect dure this long-term monitor at 09 43 08 while the doctor was on the phone in the room the patient was sit in front of the doctor confus at 09 43 14 start from the right central area the rhythmic slow theta activ was follow by general burst activ and diffus delta activ the patient is still sit on the bed look at the doctor and could not understand or answer the question pose to him correct the diffus slow delta pattern continu until 09 48 21 when the amplitud decreas and the background return to baselin at that time he still seem to be confus but no clinic or physic seizur were observ long-term monitor 12 04 to 13 04 introduct digit video eeg continu in the long-term eeg monitor unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with one channel of ekg hyperventil and photic stimul were not perform this is an awak and asleep record descript of the record in wake the background eeg is symmetr there is 10 hz 30 uv posterior domin rhythm and small amount of low voltag frontocentr beta activ at time burst of general activ start from the left or right hemispher is observ occasion sharp wave activ with slow is seen in the right posterior tempor area as well as the left frontocentr area sleep is evidenc of slow roll eye movement vertex wave and spindl the burst activ can also be seen in wake and dure sleep event there were no push button event and no clinic seizur record dure this portion of the record hr 78 bpm impress abnorm long-term eeg due to burst of sharp and slow activ general or start from the left or right hemispher two seizur each with slight differ pattern poor local by scalp eeg but perhap local to the right frontal region clinic correl two seizur episod were record with eeg correl and start from the right hemispher suggest an epileptogen focus and support partial mechan for epilepsi in this patient howev the burst activ either general or come from the left or right hemispher as well as individu sharp wave or slow wave found in the left posterior area right central area or left frontal area togeth with fast activ with rhythmic slow activ in the frontal area may reflect or suggest multifoc epilept mechan or interrupt with thalamocort interact in addit the two seizur record show differ epilept pattern in summari this eeg identifi complex mechan of epileptogenesi in this patient addit studi are warrant to provid further local
