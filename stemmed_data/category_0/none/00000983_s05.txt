reason for studi seizur clinic histori 60-year-old woman with recurr glioblastoma multiform status post left frontal resect with speech difficulti medic dilantin and keppra introduct long-term eeg was perform use standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterotempor and single-lead ekg electrod the patient was record dure wake and sleep activ procedur were not perform continu spike-wav detect as well as seizure-detect softwar includ patient note and nurs note were use to review the eeg technic difficulti some movement artifact seen throughout the record descript of the record the record open to posterior domin rhythm that can be best seen over the right hemispher and reach 9-10 hz which is reactiv to eye open over the right hemispher there is at time posterior domin rhythm that can also be seen at 9-10 hz howev there is hemispher slow that appear to be maxim at t3 and seen continu this hemispher slow also has intermix sharp wave that at time are more frontal at f7 sometim more at t3 and sometim more at f3 these sharp wave at time becom rhythmic and appear to becom monomorph but do not clear evolv at time they just start and stop in burst of 10-20 second this appear to be more pronounc when the patient is awak heart rate 84 abnorm discharg focal sharp wave seen independ at f7 at t3 and f3 at time in rhythmic burst but not clear evolv focal slow seen over the left hemispher maxim at t3 with asymmetr amplitud consist with breach rhythm seizur no clear electrograph or clinic seizur were seen impress abnorm eeg due to frequent left anterotempor and frontal sharp wave in addit to left hemispher focal slow maxim in the midtempor region clinic correl this eeg is consist with the diagnosi of localization-rel epilepsi with seizur like aris from the left anterotempor and or left frontal region in addit there is evid of focal and structur dysfunct irrit over the left hemispher maxim in the midtempor region which is consist with the known tumor resect pleas note that this record look slight differ from the last hour of the previous record in which the frequenc and amplitud of the sharp wave was not as impress these find were communic to the primari team
