clinic histori 22 year old right hand femal with histori of seizur with increas number of seizur recent refractori to multipl medic also with histori of nonepilept spell medic keppra lamotrigin zonisamid reason for studi seizur classif introduct digit video long-term monitor eeg was perform use standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit anterior tempor and ekg electrod video record was also perform continu spike detect softwar as well as seizur detect softwar along with the patient alarm and nurs note were use to review the eeg descript of the record the record open to well-defin posterior domin rhythm of to 10 hz which is reactiv to eye open the patient has normal amount of frontocentr beta no activ procedur were perform the patient was record in stage and stage ii and deep slow-wav sleep abnorm discharg onli dure sleep some focal sharp wave were seen with larg field at fb2 f8 with small burst seen rare day two event occur dure the first day of record one occur at 48 and the other one occur at 11 07 dure both of them the patient sudden state that she did not feel well and sudden start have right arm shake and move side to side with her eye close with irregular bodi motion and hand shake dure the first event she would also lift her leg and move side to side while unrespons this last about to minut then stop and the patient was back to herself the second one was of similar clinic present howev the flap and shift side to side was much more aggress and sever this last about minut dure both event the eeg appear to remain normal with no epileptiform activ or eeg correl to these event long term monitor 12-57 05 09 2012 to 05 10 2012 descript of the record day the record open to well defin posterior domin rhythm which reach hz with normal frontal central beta this patient is record in stage stage ii stage iii and rem sleep no activ procedur were perform abnorm discharg dure sleep specif stage ii to iii the patient appear to have some frequent bifront sharp wave at fp2 as well as some more tempor sharp wave there is also burst of slow with sharpli contour activ seen with multifoc region more frontal more tempor but not clear if it is epilept no event were captur dure this 24-hour record seizur none this is long-term day 05 09 2012 to 05 10 2012 total of 24 hour descript of the record day abnorm discharg as state abov focal sharp wave seen intermitt in sleep with abrupt at time more promin in the right frontal region at fp-2 and sometim f4 and quick move toward the right tempor lobe at time there are sharp wave that appear to be left frontal fp3 and sometim they appear to be more at t6 p3 these are at time all seen in complex that last for to second usual main in sleep seizur complex partial seizur occur on 05 09 2012 at 12 31 and end at 12 34 with total durat of minut and 14 second descript of seizur the patient is lay on her left side while asleep sudden she arous open her eye and jolt her bodi then her right arm move up and becom tonic while her left hand becom dyston in spoon fashion the right arm then continu to lower down and stretch forward along with the left arm while her eye go back and her moan she then start have clonic jerk of both arm and bodi the lower extrem cannot be visual clear in the video she continu to have clonic jerk while moan and then slowli the jerk start decreas in frequenc and then they stop with the last ictal jerk on the left hand afterward she lay in bed unrespons she is not test dure the entir seizur eeg dure seizur at onset there is general attenu of faster frequenc follow by general polyspik discharg that appear to be slight more predomin over the right hemispher than the left with no clear area of maxim which in about 20 second appear to settl on the right tempor lobe more than the left and continu to evolv in frequenc and then spread to the frontal region of the right hemispher and then seen later spread through the frontal lobe of the left hemispher and then general and obscur by muscl artifact at the end of the seizur there appear to be diffus attenu tonic-clon seizur occur at 00 in the morn and end at 02 in the morn seizur descript the patient again is asleep this time lay on her right side the patient open her eye about second into the electrograph seizur but doe not move until about 30 second after the electrograph seizur begin sudden both hand becom dyston and stiff while stretch forward slight and she remain tonic with tonic stress postur for about 20 to 30 second afterward she start have tonic-clon movement of both arm while moan repeat she continu to do this until the jerk after increas frequenc start decreas in frequenc and then later stop eeg descript again at the onset of the seizur there appear to be slight diffus attenu and slow with no clear onset but appear to have slight right-sid predomin although it is main general with polyspik that appear to be somewhat tempor and frontal maxim as the seizur evolv in frequenc it appear to settl slight over the right tempor lobe then spread quick to the prefront region bilater and then is obscur by muscl artifact at the end of the seizur there is diffus attenu seen seizur occur at 06 13 in the morn and end at 15 in the morn seizur descript the patient is again asleep and open her eye about second into the seizur but lay there still and about 20 second later her eye roll up and her both arm lift up in the air in dyston fashion the right slight more than the left follow by stretch forward and both hand becom dyston and then clonic movement increas in frequenc and then decreas in frequenc with associ grunt at the end the last ictal jerk is seen on the left no test was perform dure this seizur either eeg descript at the onset of the seizur again there is diffus slow with sharp wave seen appear to be slight maxim at t6 follow by polyspik that appear to be more posterior than anterior and maxim mayb under the right posterotempor region at t6 which appear to evolv and settl main over t4 follow by frontal spread and then general spread and obscur by muscl artifact again at the end of the seizur there is diffus slow seen day abnorm discharg as previous day seizur none impress the impress is abnorm eeg due to multifoc spike from both hemispher at time with right predomin but seen in both hemispher as well as seizur with unclear onset which appear to be general at time with right frontal slight predomin clinic correl this long-term video monitor unit is diagnost of what appear to be multifoc local relat epilepsi with seizur possibl aris from the frontal and tempor region in addit the event dure day of record had no eeg correl as such these event are not epilept and are diagnost psychogen nonepilept seizur
