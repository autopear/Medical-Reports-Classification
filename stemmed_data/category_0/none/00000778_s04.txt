clinic histori 82-year-old femal with histori of epilepsi dementia and old stroke in the past who present status post fall lead to seizur activ medic aspirin trilept aricept introduct digit video eeg perform in the laboratori use standard 10 20 system of electrod placement and one lead of ekg channel the eeg is perform with photic stimul and the record is perform through awak go through drowsi descript of the record the background eeg is mark abnorm there is mixtur of theta and delta there is period complex observ in the posterior quadrant this has an unusu field and has signific bilater represent but when review with differ montag is clear maximum in the right posterior quadrant t6 02 but also involv the left occipit region as well the complex do not evolv but are seen intermitt and irrit with promin after go swell activ photic stimul doe not activ the record hr 68 bpm impress abnorm eeg due to mark abnorm background promin period activ in the occipit region right greater than the left clinic correl no seizur are record but this eeg suggest high irrit process addit eeg record is advis long-term monitor august 18 2007 introduct continu video eeg monitor is perform in the unit use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg no clinic seizur are observ by the patient nurs or famili descript of the record the background of the eeg continu to demonstr an intermitt mark abnorm eeg with focal sharp wave particular right occipit pariet general period complex and triphas wave there are also occasion sharp wave from the left stimul of the patient clear produc an increas in theta there is great variabl in the record with some section of the record demonstr less of the epileptiform activ particular in sleep introduct digit video eeg monitor was perform in the long-term monitor unit use standard 10 20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg over the cours of the 24-hour record no clinic seizur are observ in addit the patient mental status appear to improv test is perform on mani occas at the bedsid with the patient and the famili present long-term monit august 18 2007 descript of the record in the initi portion of the record at the bedsid occasion facial twitch and foot twitch is observ the overal background is mark abnorm with mixtur of theta and arrhythm delta activ multipl differ epileptiform abnorm are observ includ some general period complex some triphas wave some focal sharp wave in the right posterior quadrant and even some from the left stimul of the patient is perform by the famili on the even of august 17 and clear produc an alert respons with decreas in epileptiform activ as well as an increas in rich of theta with tactil stimul the patient awaken and provid or word the sleep record is notabl for decreas in epileptiform discharg by the morn of august howev the background includ pattern of theta follow by some period complex and or focal complex there are also some triphas wave with characterist anterior to posterior lag the famili visit the patient at 11 00 stimul of the patient again produc an increas in theta frequenc activ and to some extent decreas the epileptiform featur her long-term monitor for this 24 hour should be ltm7-80 long-term monitor august 19 2007 introduct august 19 through august 20 this is the third day of her ltm continu eeg monitor is perform in the unit patient is observ to have an improv mental status no clinic seizur are observ descript of the record background eeg demonstr an overal improv with increas amount of theta and less arrhythm delta although there is some general period complex and some focal period complex observ in the record the epileptiform activ is decreas on the 19th in sleep right parietotempor sharp wave are observ the stimul of the patient produc an increas in theta frequenc activ stimul of the patient also seem to decreas triphas like wave form as well as some epileptiform activ as the record continu there is clear transit to fewer portion of the general ize period complex focal epileptiform activ and triphas wave in addit there are fewer sharp wave observ in the left hemispher with more of the sharp wave observ on the right behavior the patient is increas activ hr 84 bpm impress abnorm continu video eeg monitor in session due to mark abnorm background with initi veri slow background with arrhythm delta with mixtur of theta and delta multipl complex epileptiform discharg includ general period complex some of which are fair predomin occipit predomin complex and triphas wave as well as some sharp wave in the left myoclonus observ initi on the first even of record clinic correl no sustain seizur were record in this record overal the background improv over time as might be seen in resolv post ictal pattern the overal background remain abnorm compat with an under encephalopathi as might be observ as dementia long-term monitor august 20 2007 descript of the record the eeg demonstr mark abnorm background although there are frontal predomin relat symmetr triphas wave there is also focal epileptiform activ includ right pariet occipit bicipit and even some in the left frontotempor region the overal background is mark slow with mixtur of theta and there are intermitt burst of prolong 5-second arrhythm delta that can follow both the sharp wave and the triphas wave stimul of the patient is observ later on in the record when the phone is ring it may be the case that that stimul at that time demonstr an electrodecrement respons or flatten of the background although the phone seem to have start ring beforehand that section of the record is uniqu in that there is much more of drop out of theta on the left compar to the right and there is more arrhythm slow on the right hr 66 bpm and irregular impress mark abnorm eeg due to an abnorm background with mixtur of theta and slow delta triphas wave focal or general sharp wave includ occipit right pariet occipit and left frontotempor clinic correl although no seizur were record this eeg has both high irrit process as well as diffus disturb of cerebr function triphas wave can be seen in metabol disturb but they may also be seen in other clinic
