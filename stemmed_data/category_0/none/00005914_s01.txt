morn hour hr 84 bpm long-term monitor 10124-25 02 medic vpa pht random wake in sleep stage ii sleep there are occasion left anterior tempor sharp and slow wave and spike and slow wave compl exe these are seen on occas in wake and stage ii sleep but are more common as the patient becom drowsi seizu re time approxim 11 00 pm the patient is awak and is on the phone the se1zu re start at while there ignific amount of movement in the background the onset of the seizur is characteri zed by arrhythm theta with generous field of spread from the eft tempor region includ the central tempor region she is on the phone and move about and thin the first 20 second there is signific amount of muscl and movement artifact despit the movement artifact there is rhythmic theta evolv into characterist tonic-clon pattern at approxim 60 second after the start of the seizur the entir sei zure ration is minut and 40 second in the time sampl that follow the re is signific postict slow behavior the patient is on the phone she stop move her right side and has automat with the left approxim 40 second into the seizur she is rub her right arm with the left side head turn is seen second into the seizur and 71 second into the seizur focal facial tonic-clon activ is ident fie toward the close of this epoch the focal slow from the lef with frequent left tempor sharp wave begin to resolv in the same time period there is seizur out of sleep and till occu rs on the morn of 25 02 at 58 am the patient is asleep she had some awar day later that she had seizur she seem to be awak or somewhat drowsi like the other seizur this seizur is mark by signific amount of movement artifact the initi electrograph featur are appar at 57 52 with an arous out of sleep her head turn to the left she seem to alert from drowsi state and look to the left again in her seizur her right arm isn move her head is turn more to the left and she lean backward the seizur detector identifi this as seizur but the alarm did not activ although she is in the dark she is move her left arm bu not her right it is not possibl to see her face duri ng this seizur but by 58 32 she has the motor pattern in the eeg at least to suggest that there was again focal facial twitch as seen in the first seizur the seizur is over at 59 13 despi te the fact that this seizur eman from drowsi state there is still signific amount of movement and muscl by 57 49 there is rhythmic theta pa rticular from the tempor region but even with the filter there is lot of artifact this activ is approxim hz rhythmic with diffus field of spread in the left tempor and central tempor region there is frequenc of allus identifi by 58 09 the activ show clear paroxysm evolut up unti the facial twitch began at 58 32 with higher amplitud more rhythmic activ and by 58 28 there is more clear involv of the central later hemispher with the focal fac1al movement the eeg becom more signific obscur although if to some extent that is filter out the right hemispher doe not appear to be as involv in the record that follow there is postict slow identifi although the pattern is improv by 06 when there seem to have been an accident patient
