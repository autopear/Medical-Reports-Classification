reason for studi seizur clinic histori 46-year-old woman with first episod of seizur and known left occipit avm medic dilantin and keppra introduct long-term eeg was perform use the standard 10-20 electrod placement system with addit of anterior tempor and singl lead ekg electrod the patient was record dure lethargi and confus no activ procedur were perform continu spike detect softwar as well as seizur detect softwar and nurs note as well as patient alarm were use to review the eeg technic difficulti dure the last hour of the record there was multipl electrod artifact as they were detach descript of the record the record remain without background which has veri seldom posterior domin rhythm that reach 7-8 hz there are no activ procedur and there is some frontal central beta seen overal howev is main diffus slow and theta 5-7 hz frequenc some sleep architectur can be seen abnorm discharg focal sharp wave seen continu at t5 at frequenc of 1-2 hz in monomorph fashion consist with period later epileptiform discharg pled focal slow wave are seen over the left hemispher maxim at t5 continu throughout the record at frequenc of 2-4 hz and amplitud of 20-60 microvolt general slow wave at 5-7 hz is seen throughout the record continu seizur the patient had multipl electrograph seizur that would appear to aris from the left hemispher maxim over the posterior tempor region at t5 interv and delta rhythmic discharg that increas in frequenc and amplitud and becom better form until it sudden stop this first seizur occur at 10 43 18 and end at 10 45 second similar seizur occur at 21 57 and end at 25 51 and the last seizur occur around 10 50 at that point multipl electrod had been lost which made it difficult to evalu the origin of the seizur but appear to be similar to the other one pleas note that dure none of these seizur there appear to be clinic correl impress abnorm electroencephalogram due to left hemispher seizur aris possibl from the left posterior tempor region in addit to left posterior tempor period later epileptiform discharg and focal slow wave in addit to general slow clinic correl this eeg is consist with the diagnosi of local relat epilepsi with multipl seizur aris from the left hemispher like posterior tempor region in addit there is evid of acut structur in the left posterior tempor region last there is evid of diffus cerebr dysfunct which is nonspecif in regard to etiolog these find were continu report to the primari team to make adjust in treatment base on the seizur
