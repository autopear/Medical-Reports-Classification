reason for studi recurr seizur introduct long-term eeg was perform use standard 10-20 electrod placement system with anterior tempor and singl lead ekg electrod the patient was record dure wake and sleep activ procedur were not perform continu spike wave detect as well as seizur detect softwar includ nurs note as well as review the eeg was perform though the whole 24 hour and use to further evalu the record medic depakot dilantin keppra histori 25-year-old man with seizur right-sid after left brain tumor resect now with recurr multipl seizur refractori to medic and status epilepticus descript of the record the record open to background that has posterior domin rhythm that reach hz over the right hemispher at time and is reactiv to eye open howev over the left hemispher there is no posterior domin rhythm no clear normal frontocentr beta seen the patient appear to have wake and sleep stage chang with some normal sleep architectur activ procedur were not perform abnorm discharg continu focal slow seen over the left hemispher maxim at t3 frequenc of 2-4 hz amplitud of 20-60 microvolt there is symmetr amplitud over this hemispher compar to the rest consist with breach over the left hemispher seizur dure the first hour of the record there appear to be intermitt rhythmic discharg at hz start and stop sudden aris from the left occipit region maxim at 01 with some t5 p3 compon this are sometim prolong last for more than 40 second and consist with electrograph seizur they were seen for about period of hour and no longer seen in the rest of the record impress abnorm eeg due to left hemispher focal slow maxim in the mid tempor region in addit to multipl electrograph seizur aris from the left occipit and pariet region occur main at the begin of the record clinic correl this eeg reveal evid multipl electrograph seizur aris from the left occipit and pariet region which improv after the first hour in the morn in addit there is evid of focal cerebr dysfunct over the left hemispher maxim at the mid tempor region which is consist with the known tumor resect these find were report to the primari team
