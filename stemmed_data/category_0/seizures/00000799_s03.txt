clinic histori 50 year old right hand woman status post left mca aneurysm repair in 2003 with annual exacerb of complex partial seizur and low serum level medic depakot keppra introduct digit video eeg was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg this is prolong studi for patient who appear to have had subclin seizur she was confus dure the eeg and somewhat letharg descript of the record the background eeg is mark abnorm the background from the right hemispher is slow and disorgan the left hemispher includ high amplitud breech rhythm with left frontal sharp and slow complex with arrhythm delta activ at 15 the patient is relat inattent and the technologist wrap the head at some point essenti continu spike is note in the left frontal region seizur is identifi at 19 character by evolut of epileptiform activ in the left frontal region which is high amplitud with generous field of spread the seizur durat is from 19 13 30 to 19 19 59 suggest that this is relat brief seizur the technologist transit from this to addit record at 09 21 after the first event with impair respons high amplitud left frontal spike is note with breech rhythm in the abnorm background the patient mental status actual improv somewhat she move about although she is confus the activ remain quit slow in both hemispher there was anoth brief build up again at 40 artifact are pick up at 35 but again there is promin spike in the background with veri promin epileptiform activ third electrograph seizur occur at 58 57 the patient is relat somnol stimul of the patient doe not occur dure this test but the seizur stop by itself and as it doe the patient move about by the morn of the 7th she is more consist awak out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequenc in the background although the pattern in both hemispher are slow throughout the record there are intermitt burst of rhythmic delta which do not have clear clinic correl seizur the patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor her head is off the monitor she appear to be sleepi at 13 35 she was awak and the seizur is 12 minut later at 13 44 with the patient with someon at the bedsid in fact physician examin her the left frontal delta is promin as are some sharp wave but she is interact somewhat with the individu examin her as the student leav the patient drift over to the right the electrograph seizur is at 13 47 13 and the patient is not realli move dure the event but start to reposit afterward this event is character by rhythmic faster frequenc activ in the left frontal and tempor region with also beta accentu after the seizur was over the patient look about hr 78 bpm impress abnorm continu eeg monitor due to well-defin electrograph seizur note but with onli one seizur in the last 24 hour of record left frontotempor focus focal slow from the left general background slow quit mark in the begin of the record but better at the close of the record clinic correl this eeg is diagnost of localization-rel mechan for epilepsi addit record may be appropri if this patient mental status doe not improv hr 78 bpm impress this section of eeg which includ routin 20 minut eeg follow by 50 minut of record includ multipl brief complex partial seizur although the patient mental status is abnorm the clinic correl for this patient seizur includ impair respons introduct continu digit video eeg is perform in the ltm unit use the standard 10-20 system of electrod placement the patient has pattern of improv mental status over the cours of the day she unfortun elimin her eeg electrod dure the overnight record descript of the record despit the improv clinic appear of the patient there are electrograph seizur identifi these occur when the patient is in bed sleep without clinic correl they are associ with run and burst of activ time 19 0838 approxim minut in durat time 19 5442 anoth seizur maximum in the left frontal and tempor region with generous field of spread of note the major of the electrograph seizur are at approxim and short thereaft the patient start to remov the eeg electrod of note howev the patient did receiv vers in the morn and although there were frequent high amplitud left frontocentr sharp wave the recurr of seizur was primarili mani hour afterward interv impress clinic correl electrograph seizur for this individu were well-defin with characterist frequenc evolut despit the promin interict sharp wave from the left frontocentr region and frontotempor region introduct continu digit video eeg was perform at bedsid use standard 10-20 system of electrod placement with channel of ekg at least one electrograph seizur is note but no clinic seizur are observ the patient mental status gradual improv over the cours of the record with the patient abl to eat and get out of bed as well as particip in care descript of the record the initi section in this epoch includ mark slow pattern with slower delta and rhythmic theta frequenc from both hemispher and high amplitud sharp and slow or spike and slow wave complex mani of which are frontotempor but some of which are t1 the patient is certain much sleepier on the 6th compar to the 7th by the morn of the 7th she is more consist awak out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequenc in the background although the pattern in both hemispher are slow throughout the record there are intermitt burst of rhythmic delta which do not have clear clinic correl seizur the patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor her head is off the monitor she appear to be sleepi at 13 35 she was awak
