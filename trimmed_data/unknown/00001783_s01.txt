INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and stage II sleep record with photic stimulation. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is slightly slow with an alpha rhythm of 8 Hz. Features of sleep include: Vertex waves, Kcomplexes, spindles, and posts are identified in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation elicits: Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is awakened from stage II sleep. No significant driving responses are observed. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this record. The background slowing is a nonspecific finding. The absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. The mild background slowing may be associated with this patient's underlying brain pathology. It would not be an anticipated finding with typical phenytoin usage.
