INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  This patient seems drowsy, rapidly falling into stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The hypersomnolence may be due to this patientâ€™s medications.
