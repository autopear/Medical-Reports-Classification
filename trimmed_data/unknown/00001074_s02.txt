MEDICATIONS:  Codeine, Acetaminophen, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake but somewhat drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow and disorganized pattern with alpha and beta frequency activity.  Superimposed on this there is arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, most prominent in the temporal reg1ons, both anteriorly and posteriorly.  Occasional FIRDA IS observed, as 1s some bilateral somewhat arrhythmic delta, again maximal in the frontal regions. Had rocking artifacts in the region of his previous craniotomy on the right.  As the patient becomes drowsy the intrahemispheric asymmetry is accentuated with more arrhythmic delta on the right.
	HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Mild to moderate background slowing bilaterally.
	2. 	Superimposed arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a disturbance in the right hemisphere involving both gray and white matter.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Bilateral features were also observed compatible with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
