INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is arousable and moving about intermittently versus drifting back to sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates a drowsy pattern with some normal features of sleep, including intermittent post and spindles.  Brief arousals are observed with a lower voltage alpha feta pattern.  Following this the patient drifts off to sleep.  There is every so often an amplitude asymmetry in this somewhat challenging bedside recording seen only in the right temporal, but not the central regions. With stimulation the record is symmetric.
	HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Hypersomnolence  with difficulty sustaining arousal.
	2.	Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features are identified and there are no significant focal features.  The features described above maybe due to this patient's toxic or metabolic process.  Correlation with imaging and patient's exam is advised.
