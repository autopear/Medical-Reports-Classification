MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Metoprolol, Protonix, Dilantin, and Esmolol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is often asleep, but when awake, she is markedly tremulous.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  In some portions of the record when the patient is clearly awake, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but other portions demonstrate, even with wakefulness, rhythmic frontal delta and/or excess theta. Features of sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  The sleep pattern is well preserved.   
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Frontally predominant intermittent rhythmic delta. 
	Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the history above, this EEG is most compatible with a toxic or metabolic process. No epileptiform features and no significant focal features were identified.
