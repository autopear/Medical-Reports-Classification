INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was 
performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz, 30 microvolt 
posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye 
movements, and increasing theta followed by vertex waves and brief spindles. The 
patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving 
response bilaterally. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed in 
this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper 
stages of sleep is suggested.
