MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, aspirin, Dilantin, Valproate.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. Electrode placement was difficult due to the patient’s matted hair. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient appears drowsy throughout much of the record.  When she is maximally awake, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a suggestion of focal slowing and drowsiness with some attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm on the right before the left and some theta as well.  In some montages, the background from the left anterior temporal region seems to be a bit attenuated compared to the right.  There is no mention made of the location of the patient’s craniotomy.  
Deeper stages of sleep include brief spindles in stage II sleep without well-defined vertex waves. In sleep, there is a right frontal sharp and slow wave complex, as well as some underlying delta seen at F3/F8.  
HR:  88 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing identified from the right frontal region with associated sharp waves in sleep.
Intermittent asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right compared to the left. 
Drop-out of the alpha rhythm on the right earlier than that seen on the left, as well as asymmetric theta in drowsiness, right greater than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right.  Given the problems with the patient’s matted hair, a follow-up EEG might be useful, but one would suspect that there is a breach rhythm from the right frontal region producing the amplitude asymmetry described above.  Correlation with imaging may be helpful.
