MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Famotidine, Dilantin, Lorazepam, Morphine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrated alpha rhythm of 10 Hz. There was also increased beta in the background and theta. There was a burst of theta in the range of 5 Hz in the occipital area. The right side had artifact. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Increased beta. 
2. Increased theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was noted. The increased beta and increased theta activity may be related to structural abnormality, medication or metabolic toxic process. Absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude diagnosis of epilepsy.
