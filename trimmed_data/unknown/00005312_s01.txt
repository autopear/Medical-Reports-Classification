MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is extremely 
agitated and sweating. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: Background EEG includes a lower voltage, low pattern 
with beta frequency activity. The patient is extremely agitated. Electrodes are being 
lost during the record and the tech119logist observed assault bridge. 
HR: 120 bpm 
Technically less than suboptimal but abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta: 
2. Paucity the normal wave forms one would anticipate. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Absence of normal wave forms. 
2. Excess beta. 
Because of the artifacts and agitation, please repeat the 
study in the lab when the patient is cooperative.
