MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  A breach rhythm is identified from the left hemisphere, particularly in the frontocentral and frontotemporal regions with occasional arrhythmic delta in the left mid-to-anterior temporal regions.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in background slowing, as well as slight accentuation of the focal slowing.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Focal slowing primarily from the left temporal region with a mixture of theta and delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following a craniotomy.  The focal slowing described above may be slightly more remarkable than that seen in previous studies.
