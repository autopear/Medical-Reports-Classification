MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.?
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a medium amplitude background, a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 10 Hz, 50 uV with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by a prominent increase in background beta. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep could be valuable.
