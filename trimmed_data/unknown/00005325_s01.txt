MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Trileptal, and others. Positive tox screen for opiates. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is acceptably organized with a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  There is generous background beta, and vertex waves are seen in sleep.   
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively drowsy, but does produce a small amount of background slowing.   
The single abnormality in this record is a pair of two left anteriotemporal sharp and slow wave complexes, maximum at T1 identified in wakefulness.  The first is a definitive sharp and slow wave and the second, which follows four seconds later, is more subtle.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Two left anteriotemporal sharp and slow wave complexes, maximum at T1 in wakefulness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  In that there are two, they cannot be considered artifactual and they do occur in wakefulness.  The generous beta may be due to medication effect.
