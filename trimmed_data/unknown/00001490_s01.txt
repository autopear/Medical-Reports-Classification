MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.   
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric with a reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  Hyperventilation is characterized by some head rocking artifact, but no true focal slowing.  
Photic stimulation is remarkable primarily for a photoelectric artifact.  
HR:  56 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be valuable.
