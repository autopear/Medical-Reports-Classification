MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Reglan, Ativan 
 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are 
completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG Includes a 
generous amount of low voltage beta with a symmetric, reactive, 9 Hz alpha rhythm. 
Intermittent, rhythmic right mid temporal mixed theta and delta is identified as are right 
anterior temporal sharp waves maximum T2 and F8. The patient is falling asleep during 
hyperventilation with features of stage I sleep. In addition, the sharp waves persist in 
stage I and into stage II sleep. Right anterior temporal sharp waves are observed into 
stage II sleep. The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation with slow rolling eye 
movements. In addition, there is a generous amount of background beta but no Â· 
definitive driving response. 
HR: 84bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1 . Right mid temporal rhythmic slowing. 
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves. 
CUNICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with the patient's history of  
localization-related epilepsy and her MRI abnormalities.
