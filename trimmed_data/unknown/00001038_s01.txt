MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, Clonidine. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent and intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized with diffuse background theta.  There are prominent bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta activity, some of which are notched.  There are also occasional bursts of arrhythmic delta activity, slightly more prominent on the right and at the midline than from the left.  There is some sharply contoured, higher amplitude frontal transience somewhat more prominent from the left.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
FIRDA.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
Sharply contoured transience from the left frontal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While many of the features described above may be due to a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, there are focal features from the left and right hemisphere. Correlation with neuroimaging is appropriate.  A follow-up study as this patientâ€™s hypertensive encephalopathy is improving would be helpful to make sure that there is not an underlying epileptiform focus from the left.
