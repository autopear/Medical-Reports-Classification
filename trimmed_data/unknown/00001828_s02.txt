MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video BEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, the  background  BEG demonstrates a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhytlm1 and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is an amplitude asynm1etry with a bit more faster  frequency  activity  seen  throughout  the  right  hemisphere,  as  well  as  higher amplitude in that hemisphere.   Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. As the patient becomes drowsy, there are some bilateral bursts of somewhat irregular slowing.   There are a handful of bursts of delta from the right occipital region, often with alpha frequency overlying this.   Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR:  90BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Irregular bursts of generalized slowing.
2.   Rare occipital delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves or spikes were identified in this record. The findings described above are non-specific and can be seen in the context of a preexisting brain injury.  Correlation with imaging may be valuable.
