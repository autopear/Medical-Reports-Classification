MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ASA, Alenolol, Norvose,Lovenox, Lorazepam 
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not 
possible, but photic simulation was completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This bedside portable record is performed for an 
individual who is intubated and relatively somnolent. The background EEG 
demonstrates a dynamic pattern some portions with low voltage activity and frontal 
beta, but with spontaneous arousals, there is a suggestion of a posterior dominant 
rhythm. Shifting asymmetries are noted and in this somewhat challenging record, there 
is occasional right frontocentral delta. 
80 bpm and irregular 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing and disorganization. 
2. Excess beta. 
3. Question of right focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The general beta may be compatible with the use of 
Ativan. There is little in the way of epileptiform activity and given the history of stroke, 
focal features are quite modest.
