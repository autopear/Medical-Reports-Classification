MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The activity is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  There is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified bilaterally with amplitudes of 20 to 30 uV.  There is more significant, rhythmic theta from the left, and there is a suggestion of a breach seen on the left rather than the right, which seems to be maximum at C3 and includes activity of 8 to 9 Hz.  There is also beta accentuation in this region.  There are occasional sharp waves identified independently from the left or right temporal regions.  On the left, they may be maximum at T3 or F7.  On the right, they are more typically T2.  Those from the right are higher amplitude, but are identified less frequently. Those from the right have better defined after-going slow waves.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intrahemispheric asymmetry.
Excess theta, more prominent on the left than the right. 
Independent right and left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The amplitude asymmetries are of unclear clinical significance given the prior surgery.  Comparison with this patientâ€™s shape of the cranium, previous craniotomy, and imaging may be useful.
