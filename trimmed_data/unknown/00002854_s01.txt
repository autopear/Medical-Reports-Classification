MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 40 to 45 uV posterior dominant rhythm, with a fair amount of frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation does not significantly alter the record.  There is a subtle left frontal breach rhythm identified and two small F3 sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal breach from previous craniotomy.
Two rare F3 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Overall, this EEG seems to show improvement compared to a previous EEG in that there is less focal slowing in the left frontal region. Correlation with recent neuroimaging data would be valuable.
