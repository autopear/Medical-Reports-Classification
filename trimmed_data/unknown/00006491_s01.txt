INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are 
performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized. 
There is an 8.5 to 9 hertz alpha rhythm identified symmetrically and bilaterally, but there is 
excess theta seen in the background particularly from the left hemisphere. Hyperventilation 
seem to accentuate this phenomenon. In addition, at the close of hyperventilation, there is some 
sharply contoured slowing in the left mid to anterior temporal region. Features of drowsiness 
include vertex waves. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drowsy and elicits 
scant bilateral driving. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess background theta. 
2. Superimposed focal slowing with excess theta from the left compared to the right. 
3. Occasionally sharply contoured slowing on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function 
affecting both gray and white matter. In addition, superimposed focal process on the left may be 
considered. There was a small amount of sharply contoured slowing observed today.
