INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1   channel EKG. Patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins, a slow bilateral background of theta and delta activity is seen.  There is an interhemispheric asymmetry with some faster activity seen  in the right hemisphere. The background is suppressed.  In the left hemisphere arrhythmic sharp delta waves are seen with a huge field of spread. At times they stop and they start as the record continues, and at times they seem to go away. There is no evolution, but by the end of the record there is a question whether there would be more evolution in this left hemispheric sharp wave pattern as the record continued.
	HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Left hemisphere sharp waves.
	2.	Slow background with slower frequencies in the left hemisphere.
	3. 	Suppression of the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The slowing of the background is nonspecific but could be a result of severe cerebral dysfunction and the focal slowing could be a result of the structural abnormality from her history of a subdural hematoma. The continued left hemispheric sharp waves is consistent with an irrigative focus for epilepsy. At the end of the record there is a question whether there would be continuation and evolution of these sharp waves, which we do not see in this record.  Further clinical correlation is recommended.
