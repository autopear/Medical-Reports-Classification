MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 6 to 7 Hz, which is better demonstrated in the left occipital region.  The major abnormality in this tracing is focal slowing from the right occipital region with rhythmic, higher amplitude 2 to 4 Hz and an underlying epileptiform discharge, which may be a spike or high amplitude sharp waves, or even low amplitude discrete from a maximum at O2.  As the child becomes drowsy, there is epileptiform activity identified in other regions in the right hemisphere including central, frontotemporal, and mid-temporal.  The epileptiform activity in the different distributions is not as high amplitude, however, as that in the occipital region.  There is a left frontal poly spike complex.  
Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. 
Photic stimulation elicits some hypersynchronous, rhythmic high amplitude slowing but without definitive spike and slow wave activity.  This may be similar to a drowsy-type pattern.
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right occipital region with associated epileptiform activity.
Multifocal foci epileptiform activity, none of which are as high amplitude or associated strongly with focal slowing as that at O2, but including the central and frontal regions on the right, as well as left frontal.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Supportive of a focal mechanism for epilepsy and a structural abnormality in the occipital region.  The multifocal spikes suggest more than one area for epileptogenesis
