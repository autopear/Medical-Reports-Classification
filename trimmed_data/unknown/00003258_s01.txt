MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of generalized beta activity.  Hyperventilation increases the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The generalized beta is compatible with this patientâ€™s medications and history of anxiety.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
