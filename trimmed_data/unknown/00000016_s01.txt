MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, and Coumadin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as intubated, comatose, and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is extremely low voltage and relatively featureless.  There is eye movement, EKG, and ICU artifact. The overall record is extremely low voltage and suppressed.  Using filters to try and eliminate ICU artifact, the record remains relatively featureless and there is scant, low voltage theta activity in the background as well as other artifacts.  
Stimulation of the patient produces some muscle, but does not change the EEG and there is no variability.
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Low voltage, featureless, severely suppressed background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a severe, underlying encephalopathy.  The background electroencephalographic activity is so suppressed that to be absolutely certain that there isnâ€™t true cortical activity, a follow-up study using a neuromuscular blocking agent may be used if this is clinically appropriate.
