MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and HIV medications.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as poorly cooperative.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with a 7 to 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and excess background theta, as well as generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In this background with theta, there is left temporal wicket activity with some wicket identified on the right. In the transition to drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of frontally predominant delta.  Features noted as the patient becomes drowsy include an increase in background beta.  Occasional K complexes are seen in stage II sleep, again followed by arousals.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing a small degree of slowing in the background.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate this record.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patientâ€™s medications, hepatic problems, or retroviral infection may all produce the background slowing described above as may a postictal state.  While the wicket is a sharply contoured normal variant, no definite epileptiform features were seen, and a more prolonged recording in stage II sleep may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity.
