MEDICATIONS:   Aspirin, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  Throughout much of the record, the patient is resting with the clinical appearance  of drowsiness. The activity from the right hemisphere  is low voltage with beta and a hint of some alpha frequency activity. The left hemisphere  demonstrates  disruption of faster frequency activity with arrhythmic delta and smaller amounts of tteta. In addition, there is clearly a breech rhythm with medium to high amplitude spikes and sharps in the left
hemisphere  with variable maximum  including T3, T1, S7/T1. Portions of the record are reviewed with a referential montage again demonstrating  sharp waves with variable maximum in the left temporal region and delta in the left hemisphere, particularly the mid temporal regions. The patient is awakened  a bit more for photic stimulation. At this time, the records continues to show very low voltage pattern on the right with a bit more theta from the left and prominent arrhythmic delta activity in the left temporal region with breech rhythm. A driving response is elicited bilaterally at 5 Hz. In addition, at this time, a left occipital spike is observed during the 11 Hz photic stimulation.
	HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Left hemispheric  focal slowing maximum in mid temporal region with disruption of faster frequency activity.
	2. 	Epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere  with variable maximum but typically in the mid to
posterior temporal regions.
	3.	Low voltage somewhat slow pattern on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left as well as localization related mechanism for epilepsy. Correlation with this patient's clinical history, frequency of seizures and imaging may be relevant.
