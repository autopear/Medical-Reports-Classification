MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  In apparent wakefulness, there is excess theta identified in the background, some of which is more prominent in the posterior regions.  There is a bit of head-rocking artifact on the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing.  Hyperventilation produces some prominent, rhythmic 5 Hz activity, which is not sustained, but it is a bit more prominent from the posterior regions than the anterior regions.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. 
HR:  54 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Excess theta.
	An unusual posteriorly predominant HV response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patientâ€™s medications would not be expected to produce the theta described above.  The posterior predominance in the HV response is a non-specific finding, but is not characteristic in this age group.
