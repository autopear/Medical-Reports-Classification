MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
IN TR ODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is appropriately 
organized with 9 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low 
voltage, fronto central beta activity. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye 
movements followed by an increase in background beta. Hyperventilation does not 
significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this 
record.
