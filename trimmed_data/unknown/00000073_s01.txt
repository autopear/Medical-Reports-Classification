MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Heparin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE As the tracing opens, the patient is relatively lethargic, but 
over the course of this postictal EEG, the patient is more arousable. The initial background is 
low voltage, diffusely slow, but there are intermittent arousals with approximately 8 Hertz alpha 
rhythm identified bilaterally right better than left. The patient waxes and wanes with some 
portions of the records which are reasonably well organized with alpha and theta activity, other 
which are low voltage featureless delta and others which are a mix of irregular mixed theta and 
delta. Activity is slightly higher on the right. Through the course of the record, intermittent 
attenuations are observed and there is a fair amount of waxing and waning although the close -
of the record does seem to be better then the beginning. There is some sharp slowing observed 
in the right mid to anterior temporal region with an after going slow wave observed. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Superimposed focal slowing with disruption of fast frequency on the left relative to the right. 
3. Intermittent background attenuation. 
4. Rare sharp wave observed on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function 
effecting botti hemispheres perhaps more significantly on the left than the right. The sharp 
waves, however, were on the right. No previous EEG were available for comparison.
