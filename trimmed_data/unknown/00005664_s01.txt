MEDICATIONS: Steroids, Coumadin, Dilantin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is asymmetric with continuous, arrhythmic delta activity in the left frontotemporal and central areas.  There is a unilateral alpha rhythm of 10 Hz, 20 to 30 uV seen in the right hemisphere.  Occasionally, a slow alpha rhythm of 8 Hz, 15 to 20 uV is seen in the left posterior area. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and a few spindles in the right hemisphere.  At F7 and T1, sharp waves are seen.  A higher  amplitude breach rhythm is also seen.  
Photic stimulation produced minimal driving in the right but not on the left.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow background with arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere. 
Left anterior temporal breach rhythm.
Lack of alpha rhythm and photic response in the left hemisphere. 
left frontotemporal sharp waves 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG pattern can be seen in patients with a structural lesion.  It is consistent with this patient’s history.  The sharp waves are in the region of the patients’ lesion.
