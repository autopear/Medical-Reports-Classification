INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. Awake study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness, there is a well-organized posterior dominant alpha rhythm of 10 Hz at 40 microvolts. The patient appears anxious during the study with increased blinking and some excess beta activity. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does not cause driving. 
HR: 104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy. If there is further concern for this diagnosis, could repeat this study.
