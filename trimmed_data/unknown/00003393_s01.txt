INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed during the record. This is an awake and drowsy study.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  Back EEG shows small degree of disorganization with an alpha rhythm ranging from 7.5 to 9 hertz. Intermittent focal slowing is demonstrated in the left frontocentral area. It is characterized  by 3 hertz delta which is intermittent, may occur in brief bursts and spreads to the temporal region. Photic stimulation includes photo electric artifact and photic driving.
	HR: 	54 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Focal slowing in the left hemisphere.
	2. 	Small degree of background  disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Focal slowing is congruent with the record of a structural lesion in that hemisphere. No epileptiform  features were observed.
