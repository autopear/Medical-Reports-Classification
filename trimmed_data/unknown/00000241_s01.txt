MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others, which she cannot name. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm, which is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  There is slightly higher amplitude beta activity from the left hemisphere in comparison to the right.  There are brief epochs of sleep with spindles and vertex waves followed by arousals, and there are some subtle underlying sharply contoured theta picked up from the left.  Prominent POSTS are identified in sleep with intermittent arousals from stage II sleep.  
Photic stimulation is remarkable for a brief driving response. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Subtle focal slowing from the left temporal region in the transition to sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: More careful review of this patientâ€™s cranium is appropriate to make sure that there is not an underlying breach rhythm, which is ipsilateral to the subtle focal features described above.  In this sharply contoured record, there are no epileptiform features.  A more careful evaluation of this patient in terms of posttraumatic changes may be helpful given the history of domestic violence.
