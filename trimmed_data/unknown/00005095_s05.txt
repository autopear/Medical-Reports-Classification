INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG concludes on January 30 to January
31, 2009 for this patient with refractory status epilepticus.  During a section of the record no clinical seizures are noted.  The patient is intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a discontinuous  pattern with intermittent  versus fast activity and sharps, particularly right posterior quadrant.
By 4:00a.m. the activity is lower voltage and more attenuated, but electrodes, particularly those from the right, start to follow off.
Of note, from 1900 hours onward there are intermittent improvements in this burst suppression pattern with intermittent sections with attenuation of the epileptiform activity and a slow background.   Propofol was discontinued at this time, however, interestingly, the EEG does not really decline.
IMPRESSION:   EEG monitoring during this continuous video EEG monitoring session is remarkable for:  An ongoing pattern of epileptiform  activity from the right hemisphere, which does improve.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If ongoing evaluation is needed, the electrodes will need to be replaced.
