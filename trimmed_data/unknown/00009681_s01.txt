DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates prominent 
beta activity throughout with head rocking artifact in the posterior regions. There is an 
asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic slowing on the left. The patient is poorly 
cooperative. Vertex waves are noted as he drifts into stage I sleep. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Primarily beta frequency pattern. 
2. Excess theta. 
3. Superimposed rhythmic slowing a bit more prominent on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION No epileptiform features were observed. The beta In the 
background EEG may be due to this patient's medications. If further characterization of 
his epilepsy is needed, a follow-up study in the lab is suggested.
