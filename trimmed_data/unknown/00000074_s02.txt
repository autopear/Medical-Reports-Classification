MEDICATIONS: CellCept, Prednisone, Neurontin, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital  video EEG is performed in the lab using standard  10-20 system  of  electrode  placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG.  Photic  stimulation  was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow for an adult of this age with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz, 30 uV in primarily a theta background. There  is  occasional  shifting  arrhythmic  delta,  a  bit  more  remarkable  from  the  left hemisphere than the right.
Photic stimulation does not active the record.
HR:  90BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.    Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record. The occasional shifting slowing is minimally remarkable given this patient's age.
