MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dilantin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and modestly disorganized.  There is a  6 to 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified, which is more rhythmic and slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  There is subtle focal slowing with subtle arrhythmic delta and theta from the right hemisphere.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  Following photic, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a decrease in muscle.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed, subtle focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a disturbance of cerebral function, which impacts both hemispheres, gray and white matter.  Consideration for a superimposed structural abnormality on the right would be appropriate.
