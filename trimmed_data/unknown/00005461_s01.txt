MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  With brief maximal wakefulness, there is a clear arousal response with an alpha rhythm of 10 Hz, 50 uV.  Much of the record, however, demonstrates a drowsy pattern with more theta frequency activity.  There were two, small discrete left temporal sharp waves.  There is a clear intrahemispheric asymmetry identified frequently but not persistently with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right, particularly in drowsiness, as well as arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Prominent focal slowing identified in sleep and drowsiness, compatible with a structural or functional abnormality on the right.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right, involving both gray and white matter. The two small sharp waves on the left may be associated with his morbid diagnosis of epilepsy.
