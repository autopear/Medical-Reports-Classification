MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Haldol, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is restless, but awake. 
She requires 2 mg of Ativan during the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates continuous 
pattern, medium amplitude, rich in beta frequency activity. There is some head rocking 
artifact and there is a glimpse of an underlying alpha rhythm of approximately 10 hertz. 
Due to agitation, patient received Ativan during the EEG. This actually does produce a 
more cooperative state with again an alpha rhythm although it does increase beta 
activity in the background. 
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable only for excess beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The excess beta is compatible with the use of 
benzodiazepine medications. No focal nor epileptiform features were observed today.
