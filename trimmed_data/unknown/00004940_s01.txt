INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and obtunded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, very low voltage, with a mixture of beta and theta activity as well as shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  In this individual who appears to be unresponsive and doesnâ€™t seem to alert to noxious stimuli, this very low voltage background at times appears to demonstrate a posterior dominant rhythm on the right of 7 to 8 Hz.  As the recording continues, the patient clearly is increasingly active with muscle, eye blink, and increasing amounts of alpha frequency activity in the background.  By the middle of the record, a posterior dominant rhythm can be identified bilaterally of approximately 8 to 9 Hz.
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent background slowing with shifting arrhythmic delta activity identified in the early part of the record.
A physiological state with the patient appearing to be poorly responsive initially and then increasingly awake with an improvement in the background EEG at the end.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record and there were no significant focal features.  The dynamic nature of this EEG may be part of a postictal pattern, or may be associated with either an improvement or elimination of a toxic or metabolic process or elimination of sedative hypnotic medication.
