MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of background theta.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with greater arrhythmic delta activity identified from the right hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions and occasional right temporal sharp waves.  There is some variability in the temporal sharp waves described above with some having more of a frontotemporal and others a centrotemporal predominance.  At times, the arrhythmic delta is a bit more remarkable in the posteriotemporal region.  Features of drowsiness include somewhat irregular frontal slowing.  In the transition to sleep, there is a right frontocentral sharp wave.  
Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort, and does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere.
	Sharp waves from the right hemisphere with variable maximum including frontocentral and centrotemporal regions.
	Mild background disorganization. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right, as well as a localization-related mechanism for seizures.  Correlation with imaging and clinical history may be useful.
