MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Risperdal, Celexa. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and primarily drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In brief wakefulness, there is an  8 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity and a small amount of background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with some slower voltage arrhythmic delta activity.  In drowsiness, there are rare, left centrotemporal sharp waves, as well as two right anterior temporal sharp waves.  Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Modest background slowing.
Rare temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function, as well as a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The background slowing may be due to a postictal state or the patientâ€™s underlying CNS process.
