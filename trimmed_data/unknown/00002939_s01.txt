MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, insulin, and antihypertensives.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  Patient experienced a dizzy spell during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage and symmetric. A lot of beta activity and muscle movement artifact were intermixed.   On rare occasions, a 9 Hz, 10 V posterior dominant rhythm is seen. Drowsiness increased theta activity, but the patient never achieved deeper stages of sleep.  One episode of dizziness occurred at 15:12 during the EEG recording but without EEG change. 
HR:  84 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in a subject of this age, albeit low voltage.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No localization or epileptiform featrures were seen.  
Normal EEG does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat EEG may be useful.
