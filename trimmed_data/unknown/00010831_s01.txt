MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is intermittent, subtle asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency in the left temporal region, and there is a single left frontocentral sharp wave.  
HR:  50 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Very subtle focal slowing from the  left hemisphere in wakefulness and drowsiness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Only a single sharp wave was identified in this record.  The sharp wave was in the region of the patientâ€™s ischemic changes.  Additional EEG recording with hyperventilation and photic stimulation in stage II sleep is recommended.
