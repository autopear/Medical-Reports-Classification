MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Mannitol, Labetalol, Hydralazine, insulin, and Protonix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric but with a great deal of muscle artifact, as well as superimposed diffusely slow theta and delta activity.  Occasionally, bursts of arrhythmic theta and delta activity can be seen, as well as focal slowing in the right hemisphere.  Stimulation of the patient caused right arm movement seen on the video camera.  This was correlated with transient decreased amplitude and slow activity in the background followed by the right focal slowing in the right hemisphere.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized and diffusely slow background.
Focal slowing in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is suggestive of a cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The focal slowing in the right hemisphere is consistent with the right parietal and temporal hemorrhage in this patient. No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Compared to this patientâ€™s previous EEG of February 13, 2004, no significant changes were observed.
