MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a symmetric, reactive 8.3 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits minimal bilateral driving. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
	1.	Mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm is of unclear clinical significance.  This may be due to medications as not all of the patientâ€™s CNS acting medications were listed.  It may also be seen in any mild, diffuse disorder of cerebral function.
