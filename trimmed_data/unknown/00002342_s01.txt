INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Some portions of this record demonstrate a well organized pattern, particularly those in the later portions of the record with an 11 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a prominent central MU rhythm seen.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing, and vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS are seen in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background.  
The initial portions of the record demonstrate a subtle abnormality with a small amount of theta and a small amount of disorganization in the context of age and in an awake patient particularly in the temporal regions, right slightly more so then the left. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	A very small amount of background slowing with slightly irregular theta in the temporal regions, right greater than left, seen in the early parts of the record.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific.  Given the transient nature of the findings, they may be due to the patient’s postictal state.
