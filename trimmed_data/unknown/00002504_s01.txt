INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation. The patient was very drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous low voltage, frontal central beta activity. The patient is extremely drowsy and drops into stage II sleep with vertex waves, KÂ­ complexes, spindles, and posts.
	HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   In this individual with a history of epilepsy and focal neurologic features,  including left hemiparesis and aphasia, there are no epileptiform features and no localizing features. The excess beta may be due to this patient's medication.  Evaluation for an underlying sleep deficit may be warranted.
