MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated wearing a face mask and is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with rhythmic  theta and generous beta.  The overall pattern is relatively low voltage, particularly in the temporal regions.  Occasional bursts of Firda are noted.  In addition,
in some sections of the record a little bit more left central theta is noted.
	HR:	60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Generalized background slowing.
	2.	Superimposed focal slowing in the left central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The background slowing described above supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The focal features may be correlated with imaging.
