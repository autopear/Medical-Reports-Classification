2008, at 9:30 a.m. Intubated at the scene. History of hypertension and diabetes. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Coumadin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly suppressed. There 
are intermittent bursts of high amplitude myoclonic jerking with spike and wave activity. 
Most bursts are less than 1.5 seconds in the myoclonic jerking and the spike and wave 
activity is approximately 3 Hz. Aside from this, the background is otherwise markedly 
suppressed. Tactile stimulation on some occasion elicits myoclonic activity. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. A suppressed pattern with intermittent bursts of generalized spike and wave 
activity associated with myoclonic jerks 
CORRELATION: This EEG carries a very worrisome prognosis acutely 
following cardiac arrest. Additional recording and/or intervention may be appropriate.
