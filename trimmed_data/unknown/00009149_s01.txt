MEDICATIONS: Ativan, antihypertensives, diabetes medicine, and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is stimulated on several occasions.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a sleep pattern with some spindle activity and significant snore.  There are also some POSTS.  Snore arousals produce some asymmetric delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces a theta pattern with a slow posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz.  Wakefulness is not sustained.  Photic stimulation serves to produce an alerting response, but no real driving response. 
HR:  66 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Hypersomnolence. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The background slowing described above is non-specific and can be seen in postictal states or a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  There are no specific hallmarks of excessive benzodiazepine exposure and no epileptiform features identified.
