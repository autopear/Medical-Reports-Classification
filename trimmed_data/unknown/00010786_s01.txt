MEDICATIONS: Baclofen, Dilantin, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient demonstrates oral automatisms. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a somewhat abbreviated study because of a system crash.  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a lower voltage pattern with lower voltage beta and some theta.  At times, it is a sharply contoured background with significant eye artifact.  Vertex waves are identified in sleep.   
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Limited EEG due to short duration of the study but abnormal due to:
	Excess background slowing.
	Lower than anticipated amplitude awake pattern than expected for age. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A repeat, more prolonged study may be important to characterize epileptiform activity.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function compatible with anoxia or multiple different causes.  The generous beta seen in wakefulness may be part of the barbiturate effect.
