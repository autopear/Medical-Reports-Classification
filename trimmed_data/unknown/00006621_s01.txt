	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using 10-20 electrode system placement and 1-lead of EKG.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
		DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, there is 9.5-Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetrical and reactive. 	Drowsiness is characterized by slowness of the alpha rhythm with vertex waves and spindles in
			stage 2 sleep. 	Lateral rectus eye movement artifact is picked up on the left in wakefulness and 	interestingly in sleep. 	In transition to sleep, there is a 1.5-second burst of frontally dominant 3-Hz spike
	and wave activity. 	There is another burst of fast spike and wave
		activity as he drifts off to sleep. 	Hyperventilation did not activate the record. 	Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, although he was falling asleep.
	HR: 	60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: 	This is a normal EEG due to frontally dominant spike wave activity.
		CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG is more supportive of inherited mechanism of epilepsy, although a frontal lobe focus can also produce a similar pattern. 	Comparison with previous EEGs can be helpful. Consider fasting and sleep-deprived record.
