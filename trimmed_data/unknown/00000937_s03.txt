MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and multiple medications for blood pressure and diabetes.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  There are multiple practice push buttons, but the patient reports no clinical events during the EEG.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a 10 Hz, posterior dominant rhythm.  In drowsiness, there is a great deal of EKG artifact.  The use of other alternative montages including a reference still produces a fair amount of the EKG artifact, but stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Snore artifact is identified.   The patient has intermittent restlessness in his legs, which produces an artifact.  Despite various forms of artifact in this background including significant EKG artifact, there is no definite epileptiform activity.  
HR:  72 to 90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This 24-hour EEG monitoring is remarkable for:
	The absence of epileptiform activity.
	Markedly disrupted sleep pattern with stage II sleep followed by snoring and spontaneous arousals. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with possible seizures, additional recording with attention to the EKG artifact may be essential to try and capture epileptiform activity in sleep in this otherwise very low voltage background.
