INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient 
receives Propofol which is eventually weaned off. Other information regarding 
medications and doses are not provided. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to show a pattern 
of polyspike activity from the left hemisphere but with a generous field of spread 
bilaterally. This is high amplitude prominent to the left posterior region but essentially 
hemispheric with volume conduction. This occurs upon a background which is quite low 
voltage and featureless. Using a sensitivity of 2 lower voltage alpha and beta frequency 
activity can be noted. The periodicity waxes and wanes but occurs approximately every 
2 seconds. At the close of the record, there is artifact but in the valuable sections of the 
record which include at 12:07 on the day in question, the activities persist. The patient 
is, however, arousable and moving about quite a bit. 
HR: 110 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Ongoing high amplitude epileptiform activity with a generous field of spread but 
maximum in the left hemisphere.
