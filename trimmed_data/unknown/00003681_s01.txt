MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Prilosec, Simvastatin, Digoxin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, at times there is a 10 hertz 
posterior dominant rhythm, well developed higher amplitude on the right compared to the left with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. There is a bit of theta observed in the record and a small amount of shifting arrhythmic delta. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. 
HR: 78 to 90 bpm, irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Intermittent background theta and even some delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific. They may be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. They may be correlated with imaging. No epileptiform features were observed and, therefore, if further characterization of his epileptic focus is important, a repeat study in lab with sleep is advised.
