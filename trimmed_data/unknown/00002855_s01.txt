MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed, Fentanyl, Vecuronium, Propofol, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a drowsy individual with occasional behaviors described as shaking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates  a continuous pattern with generous beta and theta alpha and theta frequency  activity. As the recording continues, there seems to be an arousal with theta frequency activity. At 15:10, there is a burst of rhythmic theta frequency activity, maximum at C4. This is 10 seconds in duration and occurs as the patient is awakening. This is followed by a T6 sharp wave and then C4 sharp waves. The right central parietal sharp waves begin to build up at 15:11:46. Some form of shaking movements  are observed at 15:14
of unknown duration. There is another brief burst of similar theta frequency activity from the right
central region.
HR:  96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Generalized  background  slowing.
	2. 	Pharmacologic  pattern with primarily beta frequency activity.
	3. 	Bursts of right central theta.
	4. 	Sharp waves observed in the right central, central parietal and posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as would be anticipated following status epilepticus and the use of medications  as described above. The epileptiform activity localizes to the right hemisphere.
