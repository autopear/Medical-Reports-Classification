MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Neurontin and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an 
awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior 
dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of excess theta observed in 
the background and a small amount of frontal slowing, left greater 
than right. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort not 
significantly activating the record. Features of drowsiness include 
slow rolling eye movements. Vertex waves are identified in stage I 
sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and 
does not significantly activate the record. 
HR: 72 BPM occasionally irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: 
1. Mild excess theta. 
2. Modest frontal slowing, left greater than right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with refractory epilepsy, no 
epileptiform features were observed. An additional recording, 
particularly using focused montages and extended sleep may be helpful 
to characterize his epileptiform activity. No previous EEGs were 
available for comparison.
