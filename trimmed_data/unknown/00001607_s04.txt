MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Neurontin, Prednisone, and Seroquel.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there a 9 Hz, 40 to 45 uV posterior dominant rhythm. Low voltage is appreciated in the right hemisphere compared to the left with drop out of the alpha rhythm on the right before the left as the patient becomes drowsy.  There are also occasional T3 and T5 sharp waves seen in this record, as well as focal slowing at T5. Photic stimulation elicits a discrete driving response.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Abnormal shifting asymmetries, with occasional focal slowing in the right hemisphere in the delta frequency range.  
Drop out of the alpha rhythm on the right before the left. 
T3 and T5 sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The right hemispheric findings are consistent with this patientâ€™s prior history of a right hemispheric stroke, however, the sharp waves appear in the contralateral tempo
ral region.  Therefore, the overall findings support a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy and the findings of left temporal sharp waves may not be re
elated to the previous cortical lesion.
