MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is reasonably high amplitude with a posterior dominant rhythm of 10.5 Hz, ranging from 50 uV on the left to 70 uV on the right.  There is an area of focal slowing from the right posterior temporal region involving T4, T6, and T2.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of arrhythmic delta activity on the left.  These are higher amplitude and a bit slower than those seen from the right.  They are picked up in quiet wakefulness. In hyperventilation and following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes sleepy, there is both sharply contoured delta and sharp waves seen from the left mid-to-anterior temporal regions.  
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving with an unusual response at 3 Hz.  The 3 Hz elicited driving response, which seems to be photoparoxysmal, the first wave seems to start before the flashing light, and the last discharge ends after the last in train brain wave form ends after the light has stopped flashing.  In addition, the activity is a little slower than 3 Hz, suggesting potentially a photoparoxysmal phenomenon.  
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Right posterior temporal focal slowing.
Left anterior temporal sharply contoured delta and sharp waves. 
An unusual photoparoxysmal response. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing raises the possibility of a mechanism for seizures outside of the area of the abscess described above.  The photoparoxysmal response is unusual and may be accentuated by the previous surgery in the posterior brain regions.
