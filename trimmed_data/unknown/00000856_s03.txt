MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Percocet, and Demerol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well organized with an 8 to 8.3 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of background theta.   In early drowsiness, there is perhaps more disorganization than one might anticipate for her age. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Mild background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The mild background slowing is non-specific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, postictal state, or in underlying white matter disease.
