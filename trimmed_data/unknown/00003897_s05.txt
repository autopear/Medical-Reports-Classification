INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an acute post-surgical patient. There are no clinical notes to indicate that the patient has had a change relevant to his EEG on December 2. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrate a suppressed 
pattern on the left. The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent background suppression 
with occasional sharp waves on the right. There are no notations in the record regarding the use of sedative/hypnotic medications. By 8:40 a.m., the activity is considerably more suppressed on the right. There is also electrode artifact. By 11 am there is some cerebral activity observed bilaterally in the frontocentral 
regions on occasion. The overall pattern is quite suppressed. 
HR: 66bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. A very suppressed pattern on the left. 
2. Discontinuous pattern on the right. 
3. Intermittent, bilateral cerebral activity is present.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is very limited clinical information provided and, hence, little in the way of clinical correlates can be made.
