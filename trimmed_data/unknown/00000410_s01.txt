MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is 
reasonably well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm. There is a 
scant an1ount of background theta. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, 
producing a bit more theta, slightly more so on the left, with rare bursts of sharply 
contoured slowing from the left seen at the close of hyperventilation. As the patient 
becomes drowsy, there are occasional bursts of higher amplitude rhythmic, sharply 
contoured theta from the left temporal region appearing in brief bursts. Photic 
stimulation elicits scant driving. 
HR: 60BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Left temporal, sharply contoured theta and underlying focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Tins EEG raises concerns regarding a localization related 
mechanism for epilepsy. Comparison with previous EEGs from childhood and/or 
recording may be helpful.
