INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and asleep record with photic stimulation done.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Current EEG is abnormal. There is generalized background slowing with alpha rhythm of 7.8 Hertz bilaterally.  In addition, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with higher amplitude on the left, a digital focal slowing on the left, with sharply contoured slowing on the left. Vertex waves are seen during sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. The heart rate is 48 beats per minute and irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized frontal background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing, most prominent in the temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The focal slowing is congruent with the left temporal stroke history.
