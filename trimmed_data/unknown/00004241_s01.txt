	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, others.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness there is 7 hertz posterior dominant rhythm identifiable bilaterally. There is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity from either hemisphere with a slight predominance of arrhythmic delta activity in the left temporal region. Frontally predominant triangular-shaped waves are observed, higher amplitude and a bit more sharply contoured on the left. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. In drowsiness there is a predominance of arrhythmic delta activity i-n the Â·left posterior region. vertex
waves are identified in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits photoelectric artifact without well-defined driving.
HR: 72 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
3. Subtle focal slowing superimposed upon this background in the left frontotemporal region with a few triangular-shaped waves in the left frontal region.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter of both hemispheres. No definitive epileptiform features were seen. The superimposed focal slowing is in the region of the patient's
previous stroke. If additional information is required, a sleep
EEG may be advised.
