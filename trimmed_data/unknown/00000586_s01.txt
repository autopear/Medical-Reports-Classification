MEDICATIONS:  METFORMIN,  PILOCARPINE,  DIOVAN, SIMVASTATIN, DILANTIN FLUCASONE
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. The patient experiences a coughing spell during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness,  the background EEG includes symmetric reactive alpha rhythm. The patient rapidly drifts off to sleep with an increase in background slowing. A coughing spell is associated with movement artifact, but also with an increase in theta and delta.
Heart rate is 104 increasing to 120 BPM with coughing.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were observed in this EEG. The coughing was associated with an increase in slowing and an increase in heart rate. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study capturing more significant sleep may be useful.
