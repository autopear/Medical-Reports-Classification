MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, Dilantin.
 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated. He has occasional stimulus-induced tremors on the left. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow background with rhythmic theta. A breach rhythm is identified in the left, and sharp waves are identified in the left hemisphere, some of which are left frontal, others left central. They range from being quite prominent to being quite subtle. The sharp waves are less prominent at 15:31 when the record starts and more prominent intermittently. The left arm shaking occurs with stimulation but is not associated with epileptiform activity. 
HR: 110 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Focal slowing from the left temporal region. 
3. Sharp waves in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The left arm shaking was not associated with epileptiform activity. Additional EEG recording was undertaken in an attempt to make certain the patient was not having other seizures.
