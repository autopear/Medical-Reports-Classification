MEDICATIONS: Phenobartal, Propofol, Versed, Dilantin, Keppar 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the IC using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The recording begins at 4:50 in the afternoon and the patient received Phenobarbital during the EEG. Additional details are not available. Propofol drip is initiated at 5:12. There is little information provided about the use of the Phenobarbital, but propofol is initiated. With the propofol, there is eventually a transition to a burst suppression pattern particularly toward midnight. Prior to this, the epileptiform activity transitions much more to a C4 or frontocentral complex and what was initially a bit more occipital and then central. Throughout the overnight recording, there is an intermittent burst suppression pattern. Some sections, particularly 2 a.m. with a very suppressed pattern. Again, the activity is quite suppressed in the early morning hours. 
The activity is reviewed in tel at 2:41 p.m. At this point, the patient is not as suppressed as previous. Epileptiform activity is transitioning more to a right frontal central. Sustained discharges are not identified. 
HR: 104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to transition from an epileptiform pattern in the right occipital and central regions to more of the right frontocentral region then a periodic pattern and then a burst suppression pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative focus, but the epileptiform activity is abating.
