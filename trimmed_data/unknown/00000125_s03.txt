MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Fentanyl 
INTRODUCTION: Dig..al video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a 5-hour study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens the primary background is a rhythmic 
theta frequency pattern. There are broadly contoured rhythmic delta and ,broadly contoured 
triphasic waves. In addition, there seems to be an area in the right posterior temporal region 
and right parietal region. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Absence of the normal waking wave forms for an adu.. of this age. 
2. Rhythmic slowing in the right posterior temporal region. 
3. Markedly variable record, some portions, particularly when the patient is unstimulated 
suggesting normal morphology of stage 1 sleep and even some spontaneous arousals. 
4. Prominent triphasic waves which occur ..h tactile stimulation. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: On the whole this EEG represents an Improvement. The 
epileptiform activity decreasing overall. The stimulus induced triphasic waves are unclear 
significance. but they do not appear to be epileptiform in nature. 1 had dictated initially fentanyl 
as one of the medications, but the fentanyl has been stopped.
