MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. Of note, the patient was experiencing a feeling as if he was about to have one of his attacks on the day of this study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 50 uV with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The overall waking background is well organized. On one occasion in drowsiness and during hyperventilation, there are occasional, brief bursts lasting one to five seconds, typically on the order of three seconds, of slightly irregular theta.  Particularly during hyperventilation, the theta seems to be a bit more prominent on the right with disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm on the right. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. 
The patient experiences an ongoing feeling throughout the EEG as if he is about to have one of his spells and at 14:39 he reports pressure in his right leg. He reports to the tech at 14:47 that the right leg feels numb at that time.  No EEG changes are seen in association with these symptoms, and the brief bursts of slightly irregular slowing are not seen at the specific times that the patient reports his symptoms. 
HR:  68 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Brief bursts of slightly irregular theta, which during hyperventilation seem to disrupt the alpha rhythm on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this record.  The brief bursts of slightly irregular theta are a non-specific abnormality and may be correlated with neuroimaging.  The symptoms that this patient experienced were not associated with a change in the EEG.
