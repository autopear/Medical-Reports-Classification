MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is fairly well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There are occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves, which are more accentuated in hyperventilation and post-hyperventilation.  There is also occasional sharply contoured delta from the left temporal regions seen.  During the course of the record, rare bifrontal sharp waves were also identified. Stage II sleep is characterized by spindle activity, K complexes, and vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits discrete symmetric driving.   
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal discrete spike and wave activity.
Occasional left temporal slowing.
Rare bifrontal sharp waves.    
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are similar to previous EEGs from August 2002 and November 2003, however, bifrontal sharp waves were not described before.  This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  Consideration for a structural or functional abnormality on the left would be indicated.  Correlation with neuroimaging studies would be valuable.
