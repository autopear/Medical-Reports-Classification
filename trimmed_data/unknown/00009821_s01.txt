INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are 
preformed. This is an awake and an asleep record. 
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz, 30 microvolt 
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta 
activity. There is scant background theta decreasing over the course of the record. Brief 
epochs of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta and 
theta. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation is 
remarkable for photic electric artifact but there is a superharmonic driving response 
observed. 
60 bpm, regular but unusual EKG pattern or morphology. 
EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness. 
CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were observed. Normal 
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is an important consideration, 
repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is advised.
