MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, and HIV medication. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the or at the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record without photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake.  The background shows an amplitude pattern with diffuse delta and theta.  Intermittently, the background is obscured by muscle.  The patientâ€™s cooperation is fair.  There is some shifting arrhythmic delta, but no strongly lateralizing features. Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in muscle artifact and eye closure.  There is also an increase in the background beta. By the close of the record, the patient is more cooperative and the muscle artifact is reduced.  The overall pattern is a mixture of theta and delta with shifting asymmetry and head-rocking artifact.  
HR:  126 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Replacement of normal background with a mixture of theta and delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was seen.  The diffuse background slowing may be due to toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, post-ictal state, HIV infection, or other diffuse disorder of cerebral function.
