MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: At times there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm, but the background EEG demonstrates excess beta with intermittent bursts of arrhythmic or rhythmic frontal delta.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in background beta.  Toward the end of the record, the patient is increasingly confused and uncooperative.  This is associated with an alerting pattern.  
HR:  90 BPM, with occasional PVCs. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bursts of delta. 
Excess beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with recent status epilepticus, no epileptiform features were seen.  Consideration for a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy and/or postictal state is appropriate. The features described above are non-specific.
