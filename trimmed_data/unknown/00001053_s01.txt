MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Valium, and Ibuprofen. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the child is awake, and the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and age appropriate quantities of background theta and delta.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and initially elicits a burst of left temporal delta followed by more of a generalized response of high amplitude delta initially occipitally predominant and then generalized.   Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  In the transition to and from sleep, there is some movement artifact, but there is some suspicious underlying delta activity in the left hemisphere including the temporal region.  Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.  
HR:  102 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Despite some of the movement artifacts seen in the transition to and from drowsiness, this is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal delta from the left hemisphere, sometimes with an unusual field of spread, sometimes mid-to-posterior temporal and at times centroparietal, but without a definitive epileptiform complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal delta supports an underlying structural or functional abnormality involving white matter.  Correlation with imaging is appropriate.
