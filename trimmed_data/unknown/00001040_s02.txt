INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were not possible. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is drowsy. There is a pattern of generous, diffuse beta with occasional frontal delta. Brief arousals are characterized by an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity. Spindles are observed as the patient drifts off to sleep. He arouses, spontaneously awakens and speaks a little and at that point the background EEG is a bit slow with some theta and delta. In this bedside recording, there is a transition from even stage II sleep with higher amplitude delta but there are no epileptiform features. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings of excess beta is compatible with the use of sedative hypnotic medications. The background slowing and nonspecific and could be due to medications, delirium or postictal state.
