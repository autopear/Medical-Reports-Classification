MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Phenytoin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed. The patient is poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates vigorous 
continuous pattern and supports a lightly sedated adult. There is generous beta activity 
in the background and there is alpha and beta frequency activity. Stimulation of the 
patient produces an arousal response. There is a small amount of shifting slowing. The 
patient is responsive to stimuli, but does drift off to sleep with a prominent beta 
frequency pattern. There is some shifting slowing identified in the record and a question 
of right frontocentral sharp wave. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess theta. 
2. Shifting slowing. ( F4/C4/T4) 
3. Sharp waves in the right hemisphere which are quite modest in nature. 
4. Subtle right frontocentral delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generous beta and theta are anticipated findings 
following recurrent seizures with use of sedative hypnotic medications. Of note, 
the patient Is much more awake than she appeared to be by clinical examination. If 
epilepsy is an important consideration, additional EEG recording may be important.
