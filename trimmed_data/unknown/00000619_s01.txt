	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin and Synthroid
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video portable EEG is performed at bedside in room 204 using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz,
60 mV alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eyeÂ­ opening. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with an increase in background theta. Posts are identified in stage I sleep. Vertex sites and K complexes are identified in stage II sleep.
HR: 82 bpm
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	No focal neural epileptiform features are identified in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
