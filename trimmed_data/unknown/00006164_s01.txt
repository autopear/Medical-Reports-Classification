INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was not performed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is quite drowsy throughout most of the EEG.  There is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In the transition to sleep, there are bursts of shifting and slowing a bit more remarkable on the left, followed by vertex waves. 	Stimulation of the patient produces a brief arousal.
	HR:	78 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal due to:
1.  Bursts of shifting and slowing in the transition to stage 1 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were observed.  These findings are nonspecific and may be correlated with imaging.
