MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG. The patient is initially somewhat agitated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with excess beta and theta.â•– There is a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. There Is also some frontally predominant paroxysmal bursts. The patient is somewhat tremulous. As the recording continues, features of sleep are noted and then the patient spontaneously arouses. 
Heart rate: 140 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are noted in this patient who is increasingly agitated by the end of the EEG. To more completely define his epilepsy, a followup study when he is a bit more cooperative is suggested.
