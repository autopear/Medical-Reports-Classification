MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed  in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel EKG.  This is a 1 hour, sleep deprived study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In this sleep deprived record, much of the record includes drowsiness  with an Alpha rhythm in the 7 Hz range, followed by brief episodes of stage II sleep with vertex wave spindles and then arousals.  Wicket is observed in the temporal regions.  There is some snore and other muscle artifact observed in the sleep record.  The video does not indicate what produces  some muscle artifact.  As this sleep recording continues, there are frequent transitions in and out of stage II sleep.   The patient is alerted for photic stimulation. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
	After this the patient drifts off to sleep. HR: 	66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slowing of the background with an Alpha rhythm averaging 7 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a very drowsy individual who is falling off to sleep even at the beginning  of the record.  To be certain, before considering this as a pathologically  slow Alpha rhythm, cognitive testing, having the patient count backwards from 10 may be, is advised.  In any case, no epileptiform  features were observed today.
