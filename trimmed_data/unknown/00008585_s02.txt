INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Low mixture of delta and theta and arrhythmic delta is seen on the left.  In wakefulness the alpha rhythm is about 10 Hz, with higher amplitude on the left than on the right.  Sharply contoured delta is seen on the left and sharp waves are seen in the mid-temporal region on the left.  In maximum wakefulness, the background is relatively well organized, but even in maximum wakefulness there is arrhythmic delta activity in the left temporal region with bursts of sharply contoured delta with a relatively generous field of spread.  Early in drowsiness, there is prominent background theta. Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  Other stages of sleep are not achieved.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Sharply contoured delta and sharp waves from the left.
Modest background slowing bilaterally.
Amplitude asymmetry with a higher amplitude alpha rhythm on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This study is improved as compared to this patientâ€™s previous EEG, with improved background slowing.  The left temporal delta and sharp waves suggest a structural lesion on the left.  Consideration for a partial mechanism for epilepsy is advised.
