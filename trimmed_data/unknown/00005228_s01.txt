MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Recordings began 
on the afternoon of July 9, 2008 and concluded the morning of July 10, 2008. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During this recording, there is a lot of movement 
seen of the patient. This EEG is showing the left chorea like pattern of the upper 
extremity. There is a markedly abnormal background especially on the left. No 
epileptiform discharges are seen in the reading. Through the reading, there is a loose 
multiple EEG electrode placement. 
HR: 60 bpm and irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing, markedly slow on the left greater than the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform discharge are seen through the recording 
There is a continuation of the markedly slow background on the left still more consistent 
with an acute process on that side. The patient's chorea like episodes seen of the left 
upper extremity are not epileptiform in nature. The chorea like upper extremity 
movement may be related to a history of Dilantin use.
