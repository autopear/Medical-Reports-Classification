MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Depakote, Dilantin, Elavil, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well organized for an adult of this age.  There is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified with a small amount of background theta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in slowing of the background.  This is followed by drowsiness, which produces occasional, somewhat irregular bursts of slowing that can be seen bilaterally but are a little bit more prominent in the left posterior quadrant.   Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving at faster flash frequencies. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Mild excess background theta and slight disorganization.
	Some posterior temporal slowing, left greater than right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with epilepsy, no epileptiform features were identified.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat, more prolonged study capturing sleep may be of use.
