MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Morphine, steroids, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and poorly organized with diffusely slow theta and delta activity, as well as a lot of muscle artifact.  The normal posterior alpha rhythm cannot be seen.  When the muscle artifact subsides, there is diffuse beta activity.  Occasionally, 2 Hz delta activity with high amplitude in the right hemisphere is also seen.  Sleep is evidenced by vertex waves, spindles, and a few K complexes.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Poorly organized, diffusely slow background.
Asymmetric spindle activity with less amplitude in the left hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a severe cerebral dysfunction.  The decreased spindle activity in the left hemisphere may be suggestive of an underlying pathological process involving the thalamic nuclei or the thalamocortical interaction. No epileptiform features were identified in this record. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
