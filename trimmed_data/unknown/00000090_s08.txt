	MEDICATIONS:	Phenobarbital,  Dilantin  and others.
	INTRODUCTION:	Portable digital  radio EEG  is performed at  the bedside in the  ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode  placement with 1- channel EKG.    No  hyperventilation or photic stimulation were performed. Patient is sedated  and intubated just  before the EEG  recording.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:	The background  of  EEG is attenuated but is continuous. After adjusting  the sensitivity,  significant increase amount of low-voltage  beta  activity can be seen  throughout  the
tracing.  Stimulation transiently decreased  slow activity on  the
background.   The background  is disorganized with excessive slow activity  of delta and theta  rhythms.   The normal  posterior dominant alpha activity  cannot be  seen.
HR:   84  bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal  EEG due  to:
	1.	Disorganized and attenuated  background with excessive  slowing.
2.  Absence alpha  activity.
	CLINICAL CORRELATIONS:	This  abnormal  EEG pattern is indicative of cerebral  dysfunction involving gray matter and white matter.  However, the findings are nonspecific. It  can be seen in  multiple  etiology  such as the patient  with encephalopathy secondary to  metabolic,  toxic, infectious,  or due to medications as well as in the postictal phase. This clinical setting is most likely  due to  the large  amount  of sedative immediately before the EEG  tracing.  For better  characterizing nature  and the focus of the epilepsy in this  patient,  repeat EEG  when patient becomes cooperative may be  favorable.
