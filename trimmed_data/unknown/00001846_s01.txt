MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, Bactrim, and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record in a restless patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are portions of the record when the background EEG is well organized with a low voltage 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Other portions demonstrate excess background theta and/or shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  In wakefulness and in drowsiness, there is intermittent focal delta from the right hemisphere with an associated right mid-to-anterior temporal spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complex.   
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	High amplitude right anteriotemporal spike and slow wave activity.
	Associated focal slowing in the same region.
	Intermittent generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  The mild background slowing may be due to a postictal state or underlying CNS pathology. The majority of the spikes and sharps are intratemporal, but a handful are posteriotemporal.
