MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Clonidine, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed in the lab/at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  The patient is described as somnolent.  Duration of time since the patientâ€™s stroke is not known.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is left unstimulated, the background EEG is low voltage with a mixture of beta and delta.  With stimulation, there is a brief arousal with an increase in beta and smaller amounts of alpha and theta frequency activity.  At the close of the record, stimulation of the patient more clearly produces an increase in faster frequency of the background, although this is brief and localizing features are difficult to discern.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Replacement of normal background with a lower voltage, excessively slow record.
	Hypersomnolence.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In this individual with a left ACA infarct, additional recording when the patient is able to sustain wakefulness may be helpful in search of epileptiform activity and identifying focal features.
