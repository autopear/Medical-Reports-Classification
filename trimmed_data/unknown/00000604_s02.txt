INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed. The patient has a tracheostomy and is responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. The right hemisphere contains primarily arrhythmic delta activity. The left hemisphere is moderately slow and demonstrates primarily a theta frequency pattern. Breech rhythm is identified with higher amplitude activity on the right particularly the right frontal region. Features of drowsiness include vertex waves. With arousal, however, there are portions of the record where the patient awakes in the left hemisphere is similar to his previous study on May 5th. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Interhemispheric asymmetry with slow activity on the right compared to the left. 
2. Moderate slowing on the left. 
CLINICAL There are no epileptiform features observed. The changes described in this record may be correlated with this patient's imaging and clinical history.
