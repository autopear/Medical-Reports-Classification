MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vancomycin, Zofran.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The backgrow1d EEG demonstrates a low voltage but continuous pattern.   Frontal eye movement artifact is noted.   In tllis  low voltage, relatively slow EEG, there is a bit more frontal theta compatible with a breach rhythm. There is variability in terms of some portions of the record demonstrating slower arrhythmic delta and others with more frontal theta.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Markedly generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: Given this patient's cranial surgery and empyemas, the pattern described above may not be a true representation of background cerebral activity because of the attenuating effects of the food collection.
