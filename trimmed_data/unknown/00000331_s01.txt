MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Plavix, Insulin, Percocet 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This patient was admitted with stroke on 5/19/08 with increasing right hemiparesis.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8 to 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm on the right, somewhat slower on the left with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity on the left in comparison to the right. The overall background from both hemispheres was somewhat disorganized, slightly more so on the left compared to the right. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing as well as an increase in beta. A single left central temporal sharp wave is observed in drowsiness. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Bilateral background slowing. 
2. Additional focal slowing from the left with destruction of faster frequency activity on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: With only a single left central temporal sharp wave, this must be considered artifactual; however, the focal sharp wave is ipsilateral to the stroke and the focal slowing. Clinical correlation structural abnormality on the left.
