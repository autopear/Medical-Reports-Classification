MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Labetalol, Cipro, Insulin, Aceteminophen 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is not intubated. 
This is an awake and a drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy and asleep throughout most 
of the EEG. The background EEG demonstrates variability and disorganized continuous 
EEG pattern with 5 to 7 Hertz per second frontally intermittent rhythmic theta activity, 
slowing to the rangeÂ· of 4 to 5 Hertz, high amplitude FIRDA was also observed, as well 
as bilateral frontal triphasic waves. Rare left temporal sharp waves. The technician 
called the patient, did not activate the record. The patient had spontaneous coughing 
during the EEG record. This stimulate muscle artifact. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Disorganized generalized background slow. 
2. FIRDA as well as frontal dominate intermittent rhythmic theta activity. 
3. Left temporal sharps 
4. Triphasics 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizure recorded. This EEG supports the diagnosis of 
diffuse cerebral dysfunction. FIRDA may be related to cerebral hemorrhage or may be 
related to metabolic disorder. The triphasic wave may related to her underlying medical 
illness. 
ADDENDUM
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The triphasic wave may be related to her underlying medical illness.
