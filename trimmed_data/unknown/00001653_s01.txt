MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Topiramate.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a symmetric, reactive 8.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  In stage II sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in background theta.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within the limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Previous EEGs are not available for comparison, but at least in comparison to the polysomnogram, there was no epileptiform activity seen.  Because this is a long-term monitoring baseline, there should be additional studies for this patient with additional EEG monitoring numbers.
