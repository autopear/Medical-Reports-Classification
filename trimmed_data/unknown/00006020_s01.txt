MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Haldol, Xanax., and Pyridine. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an 
awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is fairly well 
organized with mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz, with a 
small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity, as well as generous muscle movement 
artifact from lateral rectus eye movements. There are rare left temporal sharp waves seen. 
Occasional wicket is seen from the temporal regions. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase 
in the amount of beta activity and a reduction in the amplitude. Photic stimulation elicits a 
symmetric driving response. 
HR: 84BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild generalized background slowing. 
2. Rare left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a focal or localization-related mechanism 
for this patient's epilepsy. Mild background slowing is non-specific and of unclear clinical 
significance. It can be seen in encephalopathies due to postictal state or in patients with cerebral 
degeneration.
