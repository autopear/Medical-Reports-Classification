INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Â·Photic stimulation performed. 
Hyperventilation not performed. Awake and drowsy study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The study opens up with the patient drowsy, which 
Is excessive throughout the record seen with slowing of the alpha. The patient, at 
minimal times, becomes more wakeful and increase in the alpha pattern is seen to 8.5 
to 9 Hz, 35 to 40 mV. During photic stimulation, no driving is seen. 
HR: 75 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excessive drowsiness with slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm for the 
majority of the EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen through this EEG. 
With the excessive drowsiness during the record, one would evaluate for an underlying 
sleep disturbance rather than epilepsy in this patient. Hypersomnolence was seen in the 
previous EEG also.
