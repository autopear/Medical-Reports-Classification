MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Keppra, Albuterol, Folic Acid, Ativan, Betamethasone 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was awake. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a generous amount of beta throughout the record with muscle artifact. The patient is not cooperative during the study. As the patient transitions into sleep, vertex waves and sleep spindles are noted in stage 2 sleep. There are POSTS and vertex waves seen. There is an bad electrode, at T3. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG. 
1. Excess beta 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the fourth EEG without epileptiform activity. Consider patient return for outpatient routine EEG or consider Digi trace long-term monitoring to capture epileptiform activity.
