INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is awake, at best, there is a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in a background with diffuse theta.  There is not a well-defined breach rhythm, but in some cases attenuation of faster frequency activity could be seen in the left frontocentral region compared to the right, and this includes attenuation of both theta and beta.  There are occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta without significant prominence from one side to the other.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Attenuation of faster frequency activity on the left.
Shifting arrhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this patient with a subdural hematoma and aphasia, there is less focal, arrhythmic delta activity than one might anticipate.  There is background slowing.  These features are non-specific and clinical evaluation may be necessary to sort out the impact of the subdural hematoma, baseline CNS dysfunction, and acute medical issues. No epileptiform features were seen.
