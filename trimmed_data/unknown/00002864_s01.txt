INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior-dominant rhythm. There is a generous amount of low-voltage frontal central beta activity and blink artifact. Despite this, there is some rhythmic theta in the left anterior temporal region. In addition, in wakefulness there are rare left temporal sharp waves. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, clearly accentuating the left temporal focal slowing, as well as the sharp waves. Brief drowsiness is associated with slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response at faster flash frequencies, left greater than right.
	HR:	76 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Left temporal rhythmic focal slowing.
	2. 	Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
