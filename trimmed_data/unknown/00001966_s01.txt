MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Darvocet, Calcium, Epirizole. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is well-organized and includes a 9.5 Hz, symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Briefs epochs of drowsiness are associated with vertex waves. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. The patient falls asleep during photic stimulation. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing or more extended sleep record could be considered.
