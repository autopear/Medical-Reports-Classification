MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ER using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible. This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are brief portions in the record where the patient wakes up and the EEG is very well organized with a 9 Hz, 50 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and an alpha rhythm that is somewhat higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  As she drifts off to sleep, there is an asymmetry with drop out of faster frequency activity seen from the right hemisphere before the left.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.   
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for: 
An amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right compared to the left. 
An asymmetry seen in the transition from wakefulness into sleep with disruption of faster frequency activity and even some asymmetric spindles in stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a process involving both gray and white matter on the right.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Given the dramatic transition between an awake and drowsy state, this evaluation for either an underlying sleep deficit or underlying sleep disorder is appropriate.
