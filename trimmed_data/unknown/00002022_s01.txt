INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In relaxed wakefulness, there is a well defined alpha rhythm, a bit on the slow side of 7 Hz. There is some frontal delta observed. Muscle artifact is noted. Lambda is observed in wakefulness. In sleep vertex waves and POSTS are noted. The POSTS sometimes occur in trains. 
HR: 114 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. A somewhat slow alpha rhythm. 
2. A small amount of excess theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. In this clinical context, the features described above are quite nonspecific and can be seen in an underlying dementing disorder. Diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as described above or other processes.
