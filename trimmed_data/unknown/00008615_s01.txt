	INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside, portal, using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with
1 channel of EKG. The recording was performed at 1331 and
several hours after the initial seizure today. There was no hyperventilation nor photic stimulation.
		DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	he patient is drowsy throughout much of the EEG. The drowsy pattern includes one of theta frequency activity with shifting asymmetries. The activity is slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. The patient is allowed to fall asleep in the initial portions of he record and then sleeps throughout much of the remainder of the study. Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.
HR: 96 bpm
		IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram 	due to:
1. Excess drowsiness, improving over the course of the record with inability to achieve an alert state at the end.
2. Intermittent amplitude asymmetry when the patient is awake with a bit of higher amplitude and a little bit more theta on the left.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: The overall improvement in the background seen in wakefulness over time is compatible with a postictal phenomena. The background in slowing is a nonspecific finding
and can be seen in the context of head trauma or postictal state. The amplitude asymmetry and the presence of a bit more theta on the left can be seen in the context of focal pathology. No epileptiform features were observed.
