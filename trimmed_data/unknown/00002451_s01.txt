MEDICATIONS: Glyburide, Dilantin, and Haldol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is very unhappy about the test and is intermittently uncooperative.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates diffuse background slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm of 5 to 6 Hz, 30 V superimposed upon a background of theta and occasional arrhythmic delta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is some shifting arrhythmic delta.   There are also occasional bursts of frontal delta. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and can be seen in a diffuse disorder of cerebral function in many different causes including underlying dementia, bilateral cerebral vascular disease, or toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were seen.
