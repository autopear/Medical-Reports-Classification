MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Hydralazine, Lovenox, Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is relatively drowsy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with beta frequency pattern with a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm. There is focal slowing identified in the right posterior quadrant with focal delta in that region as well as some shifting delta. Sharply contoured slowing is seen in lateral sections of the record in the right mid temporal region with a general field of spread. 
HR: 120 bpm and somewhat irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing and disorganization which improves over the course of the record. 
2. Two areas of focal slowing, one of which is right posterior parietal and another which is right mid temporal. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While there were no sharp waves noted in this record, focal features ipsilateral to the patient's lesion were identified. In contrast to the previous study, no right anterior temporal sharp waves were seen and there were no subclinical seizures or clinical seizures recorded. This is the 3rd EEG study for this individual.
