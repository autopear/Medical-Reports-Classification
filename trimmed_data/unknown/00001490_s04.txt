MEDICATIONS: PHT, others
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in background beta.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. These results were similar to a previous EEG for this patient.
