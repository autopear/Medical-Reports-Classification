MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others.
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. The patient is awake and confused during the recording.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized.  There is a 5 to 6 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasionally, isolated waveforms of  3 to 4 Hz, 60 V are identified in the occipital area. 
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Diffusely slow and poorly organized background.
Bursts of theta activity in the occipital area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is suggestive of a disturbance of cerebral dysfunction, however, this pattern is non-specific and can be seen in patients with encephalopathy, a postictal pattern of seizures, or medication effect.  In view of the occipital delta- theta activity, a neuroimaging may be helpful in providing further information.  No epileptiform discharges were seen in this recording.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be useful.
