MEDICATIONS:  
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  There were minor technical difficulties with this record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Frequent eye blink was noted.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic alpha.   
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response at intermediate flash frequencies. 
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
