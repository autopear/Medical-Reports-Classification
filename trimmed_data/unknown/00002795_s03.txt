CLINICAL
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video  EEG  is performed  in the lab using  standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.   This is primarily a drowsy or asleep record.
DESCRIPTION  OF   THE   RECORD:  In  wakefulness,  there  is  a  9  Hz  posterior dominant rhytlm1.  This is accompanied by excess background theta, occasional irregular delta.  As the patient transitions to stage II sleep, there are a handful of sharp waves noted including the tight frontal and right mid-temporal regions. In this sharply contoured background,  the occipital  areas  are  quite  sharp but there  is no  definitive  epileptiform activity in this region.  Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.
HR:  90 BPM, irregular. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Excess background  slowing.
2.   Occasional sharp waves primarily in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  Previous  BEGs  were  not  available   for  comparison today.    This  EEG  supports  a  diffuse  disturbance  of  cerebral  function,  as  well  as  a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
