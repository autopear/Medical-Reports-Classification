MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In brief wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well organized, 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm on the left with arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere. There is an irregular heart rate and there is EKG artifact picked up in the left temporal region.  In addition, separate from the EKG artifact, there are also some sharp waves in the F8-T4 region.  Features of sleep include some vertex waves and spindles.  There seems to be an underlying sharp wave in the right hemisphere in association with some of the sleep morphologies with a field that includes the frontocentral and temporal regions.  Sharp waves from the right demonstrate some variability, some appearing more frontotemporal, others frontocentral, and one or two that seems to have a posteriotemporal maximum.  
Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record. 
HR:  66 BPM, occasionally irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Prominent arrhythmic delta activity from the right.
	Complex sharp waves noted from the right hemisphere with more than one localization. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy, as well as more than one potential focus for seizures from the right hemisphere.
