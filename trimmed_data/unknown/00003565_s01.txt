MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Risperdal, Ativan, Neutraphos., Hydrochlorothiazide, Thiamine, Folic Acid, Lorazepam, Heparin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Neither hyperventilation or photic stimulation were completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is slow and disorganized. At times there is an 8 hertz alpha rhythm but there are bursts of rhythmic frontal delta or shifting arrhythmic delta. Some of the delta is more prominent in the right hemisphere in comparison to the left. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Intermittent background slowing 
2. Disorganization. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. The shifting delta right greater than left may be correlated with imaging and clinic history.
