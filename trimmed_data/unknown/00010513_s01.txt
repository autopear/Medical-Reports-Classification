INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates beta frequency beta activity in the frontal region. Alpha and theta activity comprise the background on the right which demonstrates focal slowing characterized by right central mixed theta and delta. There is an 8 hertz rhythm activity. In the right region occasional C4 sharp waves are noted. There is also a breech rhythm with accentuation of the amplitude on the right 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Right central focal slowing. 
2. There are rare C4 sharp waves. 
3. There is a small amount of excess Theta on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The EEG findings support a structural/functional process affecting gray and white matter and focal suggests focal mechanism of epilepsy.
