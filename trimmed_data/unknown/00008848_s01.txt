MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, morphine, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake and drowsy, and is often restless.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  When the patient is restless, the activity is low-to-medium amplitude with background theta activity.  As he becomes drowsy, the activity is lower voltage and somewhat featureless.  There are mild, shifting asymmetries.  Brief vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of a normal pattern with a low voltage slow pattern.
Marked background slowing in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the context of this individualâ€™s age, this EEG is still abnormal.  Medications, postictal state, and/or sepsis may all contribute to the pattern described above.  No epileptiform features were seen, but epileptiform activity is more difficult to identify in geriatric subjects.
