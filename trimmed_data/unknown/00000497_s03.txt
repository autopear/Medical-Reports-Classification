MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ?others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Tllis is an one-hour study with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD:  In  wakefulness, there  is  a 9  Hz synm1etric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient seems to be quite drowsy, transitioning in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, POSTS, and snore arousals.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record.   Photic stimulation elicits an alerting response.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits
CLINICAL CORR ELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The arousals from sleep are non-specific and may be due to a noisy environment, an uncomfortable individual, or an underlyii1g sleep disturbance.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison today.
