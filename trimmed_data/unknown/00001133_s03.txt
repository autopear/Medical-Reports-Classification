INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a low voltage, but relatively well organized pattern on the right with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The left hemisphere demonstrates disruption of faster frequency activity. The background from the left hemisphere demonstrates prominent disruption of faster frequency activity. As the patient transitions briefly into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles, discreet sharp waves are seen in the left frontal temporal region. In this individual with what may well be a post traumatic phenomenon and cranial defect, they are nearly electric at F7, T1, but clearly maximum at T1, but with a generous field of spread. Photic stimulation does not activate the record, although the patient drifts off into sleep during photic. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. In addition, the persistent focal features with disruption of faster frequency activity and presence of slowing support a cortical process. The epileptiform activity is in the region of this patient's brain injury.
