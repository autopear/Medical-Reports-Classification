MEDICATIONS: (See above).
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, ventilator dependent, and unresponsive during the record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is severely attenuated.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not seen.  When the sensitivity is adjusted, an increased amount of diffuse beta activity is identified.  Stimulation of the patient did not change the background.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Very suppressed background.
No reactivity or variability with stimulation. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is indicative of a severe cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The increased amount of diffuse beta activity may be due to medications such as benzodiazepine, Ativan, or Propofol. No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.
