MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Lipitor, Amlodipine, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 to 11.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is shifting arrhythmic delta activity and a higher amplitude alpha rhythm on the left in comparison to the right. At times there may disruption of faster frequency activity from either hemisphere. There are portions, however, with a bit more arrhythmic delta and the suggestion of a breach rhythm on the left. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:   78 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Independent, arrhythmic delta activity more prominent from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen today. Correlation with previous injuries given the shifting area of rhythmic delta is important given the previous history of unilateral brain surgery.
