INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was observed to have a brief 
episode of facial twitching without impairment of awareness and prior to placement of 
electrodes has some isolated right facial twitching. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG continues to demonstrate a 
marked intrahemispheric Symmetry with low voltage theta on the left and high 
amplitude, polyspike activity in the right hemisphere particularly the posterior quadrant 
with activity Including C4, T6 in the right parietal region. The activity is somewhat 
I periodic in nature occurring approximately every 2 seconds. It does not evolve. 
HR: 80 bpm and irregular 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Ongoing periodic polyspike complexes in right hemisphere maximum in the 
posterotemporal and parietal regions. 
2. Intrahemispheric asymmetry. 
3. Overall suppression. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are Identical to his previous study earlier 
this week. Clinically however the patient certainly has improved.
