MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Phenylephrine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is sedated, but becomes extremely agitated with any kind of tactile stimuli.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG shows diffuse beta activity, medium-to-low voltage.  With any sort of stimulation, there is an increase in frontal delta.  There is spontaneous variability in the record.  The overall pattern is relatively low voltage.  There are occasional bursts of shifting delta.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Replacement of normal background with primarily a beta pattern.
	Bursts of delta with tactile stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This study contrast to a March 2004 EEG for this individual, which was normal.  No epileptiform features have been identified in either record.  Given the profound agitation and the high doses of benzodiazepines used, consideration for alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal is appropriate.
