MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive and is non-verbal but looks toward auditory stimulation.  He has facial twitching recorded during the record and muscle monitors are utilized.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry.  There is more delta and less theta on the left in comparison to the right.  There are rare portions where the right hemisphere has a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm ranging from 6 to 7.5 Hz. 
Intermittently, the facial twitching is identified.  This produces rhythmic artifact in the frontal leads bilaterally, as well as in the muscle monitor.  On occasion, the muscle twitch occurs of less vigorous amplitude and on those occasions the EEG video demonstrates the facial twitch, but there is no significant artifact aside from the EMG leads.  There is no clear EEG correlate to the twitching, although the twitching does produce bilateral artifact in the frontal leads.  
Stimulation of the patient does appear to produce a small increase in theta from both hemispheres. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with more severe slowing on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal facial twitching was not associated with a clear EEG correlate.  There were occasions where a clinical twitch was seen without muscle, but if appropriate, a follow-up study may be obtained.  Technically, it would be difficult to eliminate the muscle twitch to get a better look at the EEG in this patient who is no longer intubated.
