MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Patient is lethargic throughout the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage dleta and theta frequency with a sometimes featureless background.  There was a small amount of beta activity.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response.  Rare, discrete  occipital PLEDS are also seen.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with low voltage, delta and theta frequencies.
Left occipital sharp waves and occasional occipital PLEDS.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No significant interval change is seen from previous EEG.
