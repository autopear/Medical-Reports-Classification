CLINICAL HISTORY 39 year old woman with meningitis and. history of seizures, 
admitted six days prior to this with bacterial meningitis. Long history of HIV, anxiety,
depression, now with renal failure on dialysis. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Acyclovir, Ampicillin, Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated with 
continuous tremulousness. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrated a 
pattern with mixe9 delta and theta. In addition to eye movement artifact, 
frontal triphasic observed. Dialysis is performed during the EEG. The patient does seem to drift a sleep state with an increase in beta. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing with a variable pattern. 
2. Triphasic waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This slow pattern which is variable, some portions with 
more theta, others with more delta, as well as triphasic waves are more compatible with 
metabolic encephalopathy, although this same pattern could be seen in the context of 
meningitis.
