MEDICATIONS: Baclofen, Dilantin, and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record for a patient on a stretcher. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized and includes a pattern of rhythmic theta.  Some shifting arrhythmic delta is seen.  There seems to be a breach rhythm in the left centrotemporal region.  There are also some suspicious underlying sharp waves in this region with after going slow waves.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved until photic stimulation, at which time vertex waves are seen.  The abnormalities identified in the left temporal region are not enhanced as the patient reaches stage I sleep.  No driving response is seen.
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
Suspicious left temporal sharp waves in the context of a breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To be certain that these sharp waves are epileptiform, a more prolonged study with additional sleep is recommended.
