MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Klonopin, and Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a  10 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There are unusual eye movements noted throughout the record, with a somewhat odd field of spread.  This is an awake record, and there are a handful of bursts of frontally predominant delta seen in the record.  Despite both EKG and eye artifact, there are a handful of suspicious right temporal sharp waves.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional frontally predominant rhythmic delta.
Suspicious right frontotemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: FIRDA is a non-specific finding and can be seen in a postictal state, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, or other neurologic conditions.  The suspicious right temporal sharp waves raise the possibility of a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  Given the eye movement artifact, a follow-up study in sleep may be helpful.  This is in contrast to a single, previous EEG 03/18/04, which was normal.
