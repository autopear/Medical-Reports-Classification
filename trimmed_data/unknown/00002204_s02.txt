MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Fentanyl, Versed.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a rich mixed frequency background with generous beta, theta and some alpha frequency activity. There is an asymmetry with a bit more alpha frequency activity on the right than the left. The patient is awake intermittently, agitated and moving about but not terrible so.   
HR:    110 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Replacement of normal background with a mixed frequency pattern rich in beta and theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted. The asymmetry in beta frequency may be correlated with imaging and subdural hematoma.
