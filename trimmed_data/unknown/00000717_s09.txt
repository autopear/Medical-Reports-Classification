INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG In a patient with a recent craniotomy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall EEG is lower voltage with a mixed frequency pattern with generous beta. It is still possible to identify some focal slowing on the left in this individual with the recent craniotomy. A breech rhythm is identifiable. 
HR: 114 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage primarily beta frequency pattern. 
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the left. 
3. Rare left sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform activity in this record is markedly improved. This is a much lower voltage and slower record than previous. Clinical correlation is suggested.
