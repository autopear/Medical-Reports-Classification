MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antihypertensives, Haldol, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is uncooperative during the recording
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and continuous with a great deal of muscle movement artifact superimposed on the background, as well as eye blink activity.  The technician has to reattach the electrodes frequently.  When the muscle activity transiently subsides, a posterior dominant alpha rhythm of 8 Hz can be seen.  There is also a diffuse amount of increased beta activity seen on the background.  Sleep was not achieved in this record. 
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Mildly slow alpha rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The mildly slow alpha rhythm is a non-specific finding and can be seen in a cortex dysfunction, very drowsy patients, or medication effect.  The background was superimposed with a great deal of muscle movement artifact, which obscured the observation of any abnormal epileptiform discharges.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
