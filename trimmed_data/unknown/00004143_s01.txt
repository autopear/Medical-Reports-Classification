MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Diamox, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video  EEG  is  perfom1ed in the  lab  using  standard  10-20 system  of electrode  placement  with  one  channel  of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD: In  wakefulness,  the  background  BEG is  well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 30 J-V posterior  dominant rhytlm1 and a small amow1t of low voltage, frontocentral  beta  activity.    Drowsiness  is characterized  by attenuation  of  the alpha rhythm.  There is snore artifact  which is unfo1iunately picked  up in the temporal regions.  Vertex waves and K complexes are seen in stage II sleep.  The snoring seems to produce an arousal from sleep.
Hyperventilation  is  performed   with  fair  effort  and does  not  significantly  activate  the record.  Photic stimulation does not significantly  activate the record.
HR:  86 BPM with frequent PVCs and APCs.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep. CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  No   definite   focal   or   epileptiform   features  were
identified in this record.   Consideration  for treatment of this patient's hypersomnolence and snoring might be appropriate.   To further characterize her epilepsy,  a follow-up, more prolonged sleep study could be useful.
