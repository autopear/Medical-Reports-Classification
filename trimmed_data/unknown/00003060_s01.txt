MEDICATIONS: Labetalol, Dilantin, Gentamicin, and Lotrimin.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and includes primarily a theta frequency pattern.  There is intrahemispheric asymmetry with more theta on the left compared to the right and some arrhythmic delta activity seen from the right.  The left hemisphere demonstrates primarily 7 Hz theta with the arrhythmic delta activity picked up in the right hemisphere, particularly the right posterior quadrant.  There is some variability in the record with some portions being richer in beta and others, when the patient is awake, richer in theta and alpha frequency activity.  As the patient becomes intermittently drowsy, there is an increase delta in the left frontal region.  
HR:  78 BPM with PVCs.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere characterized by an increase in background delta and decrease in faster frequency.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right affecting both gray and white matter.  No epileptiform features were seen.
