MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, insulin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and unresponsive.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized and asymmetric with a reduced left amplitude in the left hemisphere.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not seen.  Moderately increased amounts of beta activity were seen throughout the tracing, more in the frontocentral region. Excessively slow theta and delta were seen in both hemispheres, more so in the right hemisphere.  Occasional slow sharp-like activity was seen in the left frontocentral region.  Stimulation of the patient did not significantly cause variability or reactivity on the background. 
HR:  96 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized background.
Background slowing with absent alpha rhythm.
Asymmetric EEG pattern with decreased amplitude in the left hemisphere.
Excessively slow theta and delta activity, especially in the right hemisphere.
Occasional slow sharp-like activity seen in the left frontocentral region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is indicative of a cerebral dysfunction involving mainly gray matter on the left and white matter on the right.  This is consistent with multiple MVAs in this patient.  The slow sharp-like activity seen in the left quadrant may be the consequence of an acute stroke, but does not necessarily mean a seizure.  Clinical correlation is recommended. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
