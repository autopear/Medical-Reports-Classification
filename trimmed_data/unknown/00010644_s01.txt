	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is performed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, background EEG is low voltage. There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a very subtle asymmetry with a bit more slowing in the right seen at times compared to the left. There is also a small amount of excess background theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta. Vertex waves are identified in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving a response. In addition, POSTs are identified at that time.
HR: 120 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess background theta.
	2. 	Subtle asymmetry with mild slowing from the right.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	No epileptiform features were seen. The mild background beta and mild excess theta are of unclear significance and may be correlated with medications or clinical history. The subtle slowing is congruent with a past history of an intracerebral hemorrhage. If seizures are an important
concern, and events are frequent, an outpatient ambulatory EEG may be
of use.
