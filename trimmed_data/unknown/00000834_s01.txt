CLINICAL 59 year old woman with epilepsy, history of meningoma, left craniotomy, 
dementia, found down in a confused state with an episode of clenching in the emergency room. 
The patient was intubated and paralyzed for a complex partial seizure and initially profoundly 
unresponsive. 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are 
performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a continuous of a prominent amplitude asymmetry 
with much higher amplitude primarily theta frequency activity on the right. The activity is lower 
voltage on the left. Intermittent beta bursts are noted. These are more prominent left central and 
midline than on the right, but the beta activity demonstrates shifting asymmetry. Tactile  
stimulation produces withdrawal. In this sharply contoured background, there are right 
frontocentral sharp waves. Some of these seem to be more maximum in the frontal regions and 
others central temporal. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. At the close of the 
record additional sharp waves some of which are F8, but others which seem to be a bit more 
maximum at T6, are observed. There is some slow quasi periodic activity noted as the patient 
drifts off to sleep with a very slow periodicity about 1 complex per 3 seconds.
 
HR: 96 to 110 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly abnormal background with an amplitude asymmetry, higher amplitude on the 
right compared to the left. 
2. Beta symmetry. 
3. In this sharply contoured record, sharp waves in the right hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance. There  
is 
increased amplitude on the right given the history or left craniotomy. No epileptiform features 
were noted.
