MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital  video EEG  is  performed  in the lab  using  standard  10-20 system  of  electrode   placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG.  Photic  stimulation  was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. There is some electrode artifact noted in this record. The patient had a cough, thus hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is some frontal EKG rocking artifact due to the craniotomy defect, but there also appears to be a small amount of frontal rhythmic theta. Features   of  drowsiness  include  slow  rolling  eye  movements.    Photic  stimulation  is remarkable for both a driving response and LAMBDA
HR:  80BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Frontal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite  the irregularities in the shape  of this patient's skull, there is a little bit of frontal theta.  No epileptiform features were noted today.
