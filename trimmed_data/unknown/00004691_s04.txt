INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz, 50 mV posterior dominate rhythm observed. A breech rhythm is identified in the right, particularly the right central region. Occasional, subtle underling slowing is observed, primarily in the right hemisphere, particularly the central parietal region. Photic stimulation elicits a subtle bilateral driving, but the patient's breech rhythm is prominently accentuated at this time. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Subtle focal slowing in the right hemisphere and the right central temporal region with associated breech rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above support a structural abnormality on the right as well as previous craniotomy. This was the fourth EEG this year. No sharp waves were observed today.
