MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Digoxin, Insulin, Heparin, Lasix, LisinoprilÂ· 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somnolent but sometimes 
awake and moving about. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite a fair amount of muscle movement artifact, 
beneath this the background is 5-7 Hz. beta pattern with a small amount of delta. At 
times, the muscle artifact is asymmetric, more so on the right than the left. Coughing is 
associated with an alerting response and when the patient is left alone he becomes a 
little drowsy with an increase in delta and slow rolling eye movements. 
HR: 84 bpm 
 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. In this individual 
with a large cystic brain lesion, despite the limitations described above. there are no 
significant focal features.
