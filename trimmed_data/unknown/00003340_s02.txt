ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system  of  electrode  placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG.    The  patient  is  asleep throughout much of the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the EEG demonstrates stage II sleep with  vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles.  The patient  alerts briefly for photic stimulation, which is partly marred by photoelectric artifact.  She is essentially in stage II sleep but arouses very briefly.  There are symmetric POSTS picked up, there is a single left parietal spike noted in the sleep record.
HR:   96BPM
IMPR  ESSION: This EEG must be considered abnormal due to:
1. A single left parietal sharp
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG contrasts to previous records which identify much more severe parietal occipital spiking.   There was only one spike seen in this record.  Clinical evaluation may be helpful to determine why this patient is so sleepy.
