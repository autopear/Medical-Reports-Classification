MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient is somewhat drowsy, but arousable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG includes a somewhat slow pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 to 8 Hz.  When not stimulated, the patient drifts off to sleep.  There is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity seen as he drifts off to sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	Mild slowing of the background.
	
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background is slow for a subject of this age.  Some shifting arrhythmic delta activity in drowsiness for an adult of this age is outside of the range of normal, but is only mildly abnormal.
