INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly abnormal. At best, 
there is a state of frequency pattern with superimposed delta. The background also 
includes periodic sharp waves and periodic triphasic waves. These wave forms are not 
all stereotypic. Some are maximum in the right hemispheres, some are bifrontal in 
others and bilaterally posteriorly. These wave forms demonstrated penidia patten, 
which ranges from 1.31 to 1.48 per second. The patient is awake and has some 
spontaneous movements. The patient is tested during the EEG to see if stimulus 
induced myoclonÂ·us can be elicited. There is no clear reaction to this, although it did 
seem to produce less in the way of the periodic sharps and more in the theta frequency 
activity. One minute afterwards, the patient seems to be attempting to move his hands 
and he has tremulousness of his hands, in the right hand it almost seems to be 
purposeful. A cough gives some muscle and then there is a train of these periodic 
complexes, right greater than left, right more remarkable than left, but bi-hemispheric 
and he seems to be trying to use his extremities, but he has myoclonic jerking of the 
extremities at the same time. This is approximately 15 seconds in duration. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Pseudoperiodic complexes, unidentified, some of which are generalized, some 
of which are anteriorly predominant, others which are posteriorly predominant, 
and some of which are maximum in the right hemisphere, marked back on 
slowing.
