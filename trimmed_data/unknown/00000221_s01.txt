	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, methadone,  Protonix.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This
	is an awake and asleep record. 
			DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness back 	und abnormal. There is prominent 5 Hz central mu like activity. There is no real well defined alpha rhythm and the overall background is a mixture of theta and delta. Occasional bursts of notched, frontal delta are observed and are accentuated by hyperventilation. In addition, there is some central beta activity identified  bilaterally but with some asymmetries in terms of the beta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
	HR: 	72 bpm
	IM PRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly abnormal background with absence of some of the normal developmental  features anticipated in an adult of this age.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. ?Left posterior temporal sharp waves.
4. Bursts of notched, frontal delta raising the concerns about generalized spike in wave complex.
5. Unusual and asymmetric beta in central regions.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	These background abnormalities are of unclear clinical significance. Considerations could include a post ictal state, a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, or
prolonged impact of CNS-acting medications. Additional clinical information may be helpful to put this in the appropriate context. If this patient is thought to be recovering from a transient CNS insult, a follow up study may be of use.
