MEDICATIONS: Decadron, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm identified, which ranges from 8.5 to 9.5 Hz.  There is excess background theta identified in the awake background.  In wakefulness, there is an intrahemispheric asymmetry characterized by disruption of the alpha on the right with excess theta from the right hemisphere, particularly the temporal, central, and parietal regions.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of more prolonged focal slowing.  There are rare right temporal sharp waves identified in the record, and there are two left anteriotemporal sharp waves.   Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread with disruption of faster frequency activity and arrhythmic delta activity.
	Rare right anteriotemporal sharp waves. 
	Two left anteriotemporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right, as well as a localization-related mechanism for seizures.
