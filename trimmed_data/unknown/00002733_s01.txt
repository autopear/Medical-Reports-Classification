MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is confused with eyes opened and unresponsive, not able to follow commands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and intermixed with theta and delta activity.  A breach rhythm was seen in the left central area characterized by focal theta and delta activity.  Occasional brief episodes of tremor lasting for 3 to 5 seconds were observed, but without an EEG correlate.  Stimulation of the patient produced reactivity and variability.
HR:  102 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing.
Breach rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG tracing demonstrates a generalized disturbance of cerebral function involving both gray and white matter.  This is a non-specific pattern and can be seen in patients with encephalopathy due to metabolic, toxic, infectious, or medication effect.  The left central breach rhythm is due to a skull defect (craniotomy).  No epileptiform discharges were observed during this tracing.
