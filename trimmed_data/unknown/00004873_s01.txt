MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Decadron. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is confused.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow and disorganized pattern.  The primary frequency from both hemispheres is in the range of theta.  There is much more muscle artifact on the left compared to the right.  The right hemisphere demonstrates irregular sharply contoured delta with an underlying sharp wave complex in the right hemisphere including T6, P4, and to a lesser extent C4.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a decrease in muscle activity.  With the use of a notched filter, as the patient becomes drowsy, the epileptiform activity is most spiky at P4 compared to T6, but there is some variability and surprisingly, with the use of an average reference, there is sometimes a phase reversal between P4 and T6.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is occasional generalized slow arrhythmic delta. In stage II sleep, spindles were seen. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere maximum in the posteriotemporal and parietal regions. 
Sharp waves in the same region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, as well as a structural abnormality.  The epileptiform activity is posterior to the hemorrhagic lesion, but the arrhythmic delta activity is in the region of the right anteriotemporal hemorrhage.
