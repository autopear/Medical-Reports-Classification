ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation and Hyperventilation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel ofEKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow from the right hemisphere with primarily a theta frequency background.  The left hemisphere demonstrates some sharply contoured slowing with a likely breech rhythm from the left scalp region.  In addition, there is the left central sharp and slow wave complex which is identified  in  wakefulness, accentuated in  drowsiness.    Other  features  of  drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.   Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR:  90BPM.
IMPR  ESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Mild background slowing from the right
2.  Sharply contoured slowing from the left with a left central sharp wave
C        LINICAL  CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality.  Tllis may be correlated with imaging studies.   The left central spike  and slow  wave  complex supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy however,  previous  craniotomy will accentuate underlying epileptifom1 activity.
