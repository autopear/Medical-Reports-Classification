MEDICATIONS: Ativan and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized with a 6.5 to 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 30 to 50 uV and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic slowing, as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If further characterization of this patientâ€™s epileptic disorder is needed, a follow-up study in the lab is recommended.
