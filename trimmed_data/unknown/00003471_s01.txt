MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly disorganized and slow.  At best, a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is identified in the posterior regions. The background is overall low voltage, and occasional delta is identified from the left hemisphere, primarily the temporal regions.  This is accentuated by hyperventilation.  Photic stimulation does not significantly alter the record.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized background slowing.
Slow underlying delta from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform discharges were seen.  The left hemispheric slowing suggests a chronic process involving the white matter of the left hemisphere.  This correlates with the previous imaging findings of a left temporal encephalomalacia. If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat tracing under sleep deprived conditions in order to capture deeper stages of sleep would be valuable.
