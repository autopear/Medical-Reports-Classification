MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8 to 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a subtle asymmetry with asymmetric slowing, greater theta and delta from the right hemisphere compared to the left.  In addition, there are a handful of right centrotemporal sharp waves identified in drowsiness and in hyperventilation.  Hyperventilation also produces similar slowing.  
In stage I sleep, POSTS are identified, which are higher in amplitude, sometimes in the right compared to the left.  Photic stimulation elicits no driving. 
HR:  112 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing. 
Right temporal and centrotemporal sharps. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given this patientâ€™s history of cerebral palsy and left hemiparesis, the focal features are less remarkable than one might expect.  The epileptiform activity is contralateral to the hemiparesis.
