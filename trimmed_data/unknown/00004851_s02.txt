INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was 
performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE In wakefulness the background EEG is low voltage 
and has no alpha rhythm. Throughout the record the patient is sleepy, and there is right 
central temporal slowing intermittently. In addition, there are sharp waves appreciated in 
the background, particularly at T4, T6, and C4. There is no significant response to 
photic stimulation with no driving. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Overall slow record with no alpha rhythm and low voltage. 
2. Sharp waves in T 4, C6, and C4. 
3. Focal slowing on the right central temporal region 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG record is supportive of a localization for this 
patient's seizures given his history of intracranial hemorrhage.
