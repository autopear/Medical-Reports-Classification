INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is conversant, but 
somewhat confused. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a somewhat slow 
pattern, but there is a definable 8 Hz alpha rhythm with excess theta. In this bedside 
record there are minor, shifting asymmetries, particularly in frontal central beta. Sleep is 
not sustained. 
HR: 60 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1 . Excess theta. 
2. Mild shifting asymmetries with a little less beta activity in the left frontal region. 
CLINICAL In the context of DKA these findings could represent a 
metabolic pattern or they could be correlated with a structural abnormality. If there is 
any concern about additional seizures, a follow up EEG recording is suggested.
