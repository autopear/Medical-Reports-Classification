MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Dilantin, Gentomycin, Vancomycin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Due to this patient’s medical circumstances, this was a limited, 10 minute study.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG has significant artifact.  The overall pattern is low voltage with theta and delta.  The activity includes perhaps a breach rhythm with higher amplitude theta frequencies from the left as compared to the right.  There is variability in the record and some portions of the record show more rhythmic delta on the left than the right.  The right is overall low voltage, slow, with beta and delta.  Stimulation of the patient produced an alerting response with an increase in theta frequency activity from the left hemisphere. 
HR:  60 to 100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Interhemispheric asymmetry with overall, relatively low voltage suppressed pattern from the right and higher voltage theta, delta, and smaller amounts of beta from left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: NOT DICTATED…..
