INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Back under EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of 
theta and delta. There is a poorly defined posterior-dominant rhythm. Shifting arrhythmic 
delta is observed from either hemisphere, but it is a bit more prominent from the left. 
There is a significant amount of muscle and movement artifact observed in this bedside 
record. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background swelling and disorganization. 
2. Slight predominance of focal swelling on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No spikes were observed today. However, there is a fair 
amount of muscle and movement artifact. If epilepsy is an important consideration a 
follow-up study is advised.
