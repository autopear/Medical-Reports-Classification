MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Phenobarbital, Percocet, Seroquel, Ativan 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 EKG. Hyperventilation and voice stimulation were 
performed. Awake and drowsy study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background shows alpha at 10.5 Hz. The patient is 
quite drowsy during the entire record and generous beta and theta is seen. During stage 
of sleep, posts are seen, left greater than right, but this is non pathological in nature. 
Photic stimulation was done and asymmetric driving greater on the left was seen, as the 
patient falls asleep. This is pathological in nature. Low-voltage occipital delta was also 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Asymmetric driving seen greater on the left especially as he begins to fall asleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The beta is consistent with history of benzodiazepines. No 
clinical correlation for asymmetric driving on the left. Imaging is recommended.
