INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern with an intrahermispheric asymmetry. The left side demonstrates frequent sharp waves with generous field of spread. Some of them are at P3 or S7, but others are at C3. In addition, there is disruption of faster frequency activity. The sharp waves on the left may demonstrate a frontal predominance and may appear invert brief trains. On one occasion, oral automatisms occur, and after this stopped there seems to be a train of sharply contoured beta in the left frontal region not involving the C3 area which includes a sharp wave there. The technologist does not seem to be aware of this event The right hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta. A second burst occurs in the left frontal region, frontotemporal region, again without clinical correlate. This second burst does seem to demonstrate some frequency evolution and abates as the technologist stimulates the patient A third more prolonged burst occurs but without such clearly defined frequency evolution. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent intrahemispheric asymmetry with marked slowing on the left_ 
2. Left frontal and frontotemporal sharp waves, some of which demonstrate frequency evolution but without strong clinical correlate. 
3. Left central sharp waves which can occur independently of the discharges in the left frontal region. 
4. Marked slowing and disorganization on the right 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a very irritative process. In addition, consideration for the potential for subclinical seizures is important in this critically ill patient.
