MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, Propofol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as agitated when stimulated, but otherwise obtunded.  He is intubated and trached. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is resting comfortably, he is drowsy.  The overall background is low voltage, mixed frequency with beta, delta, and some faster frequency activity.  There is ICU artifact, but no true asymmetries in the EEG.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an increase in beta, alpha, and theta frequency activity.  Intermittently, there is some electrode artifact in the left temporal electrodes.  
Towards the close of the record, with alerting, there is more rhythmic alpha and theta frequency activity but no well-defined alpha rhythm. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
	1.	Generalized, relatively symmetric background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In that this patient has had frequent seizures, a follow-up study may be of use.
