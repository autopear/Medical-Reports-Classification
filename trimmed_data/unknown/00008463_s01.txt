MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Loratadine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 1 0-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are 
performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized 
with 11 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage 
frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record, producing 
an increase in amplitude of the background. At the close of hyperventilation in a sharply 
contoured background, there appear to be isolated left temporal spikes. Photic 
stimulation elicits a driving response. The patient seems to be drifting off into photic 
and during photic there is a question of what may be the patient's third left temporal 
sharp wave. 
HR: 90 bpm. 
IM PRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Three left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the sharply contoured nature of this record, if there 
are any additional concerns, a repeat tracing, capturing deeper stages of sleep may be 
helpful if further information is needed regarding epileptiform activity.
