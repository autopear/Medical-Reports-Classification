MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Valproic acid, Phenobarbital, Morphine, and others. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-
20 system  of electrode  placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is lethargic,  but easily
arousable and somewhat restless.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: As the tracing opens, the backgrow1d EEG is continuous but disorganized  with  excess beta activity.   High amplitude  beta  is seen  more  from  the right frontal region.  There is also intermittent delta activity seen from the right posterior quadrant with some volw11e conduction  to the left posterior  region.  A breach rhythm  is also identified  in the right posterior region. Occasional FIRDA is seen.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
HR.: 72 BPM.
IM    PRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Excess beta activity.
2.   Focal slowing from the right posterior region.
3.   Occasional FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is consistent with the patient's neuroimaging  data with a lesion  to the right hemisphere and previous craniotomy.   The excess beta may be due to medication effect.  The FIRDA is a non-specific finding and can be seen in many different types of cerebral disturbances such as encephalopathies of metabolic, toxic, or infectious origin.
