MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and well organized for age.  There is an 8 to 10 Hz, 50 to 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm, which attenuates with eye opening. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation increased the burst of theta slow wave activity in the background.  There is a single T3 sharp wave without focal slowing.  Occasionally, occipital slow activity and POSTS were seen in drowsiness. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and vertex waves. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  Photic stimulation elicits mild subharmonic driving.  
HR:  86 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal awake and drowsy EEG in a subject of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to this patientâ€™s previous EEG, this tracing shows improvement without focal slowing. Only one sharp wave was observed in the left temporal area, which can be seen in a normal subject of this age.  The posterior slow waves of youth and POSTS are normal variants. Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.
