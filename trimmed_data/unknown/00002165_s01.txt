MEDICATION: Dilantin, Insulin and hypertensive medications. ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation and Hyperventilation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The  background EEG is abnormal and demonstrates a dynamic pattern. At times, there is ï¿½7-8 Hz background . There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta. In addition, on some occasions, there is some asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta from the left frontal region on the right. Features of drowsiness include increasing frontal delta and accentuation of focal slowing.
HR: 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing
Intermittent bursts of frontal delta
Intermittent focal slowing on the left
CLINICAL CORRELATION : No spike or sharp waves were seen. The features described above are non-specific but the frontal delta and generalized slowing were metabolic.  The focal features described above may be evaluated by imaging.
