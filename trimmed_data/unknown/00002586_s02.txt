INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode 
placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation performed. Awake through stage II sleep. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: A slowing of the background is seen. An interhemispheric. 
asymmetry is seen with slower frequencies in the right hemisphere. A posterior dominant rhythm 
is-seen at 7.5 Hz on the left and 6Hz at a maximum on the right. The slowing of the background 
is mostly a theta pattern with occasional superimposed delta activity. As the patient increasingly 
gets drowsy, the record gets a bit slower and stage II sleep is seen With vertex waves and 
 spindles. Asymmetric spindles are seen on the record located in the left hemisphere. There is 
some minimal sleep pattern seen on the right. Photic stimulation does cause driving and the 
patient begins to fall asleep during the stimulation. 
HR: 96 bpm With a bifid morphology of the QRS complex with PVCs occasionally. 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Bilateral slowing of the background with slower rhythm seen in the right hemisphere. 
2. Loss of some sleep morphology seen on the right hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity or seizures recorded in this 
record. The patient's study is consistent with cerebral dysfunction with slower activity seen in the 
right hemisphere. This could be consistent with the previous left MCA and now the acute right 
MCA CVA.
