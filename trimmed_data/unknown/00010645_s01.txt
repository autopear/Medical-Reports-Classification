MEDICATIONS: Tylenol, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the child is awake and the EEG is relatively symmetric.  The background EEG includes a 5.6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but as the child becomes drowsy, there is an underlying in the area of delta particularly from the right posterior quadrant.  As the patient becomes sleepier, there are very prominent, high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes from the right hemisphere maximum in the mid-temporal region but with generous spread into the centrotemporal region.  This persists into stage II sleep, becoming increasingly high in amplitude, almost in trans with some spread or volume conduction to the left.   It does not appear that there are independent left centrotemporal sharp waves.  These become polyspike or at least without actual five phases, but with multiple phases and in stage II sleep on occasion.  In some sections, in stage II sleep, they are seen nearly every second and in other stages of stage II sleep, the child may go as long as 10 seconds without a spike and slow wave complex.  No clinical signs are associated with this frequent epileptiform discharge. 
HR:  132 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Spike and wave activity from the right hemisphere, maximum in the right centrotemporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the presence of a high amplitude spike and slow wave discharge, as well as underlying focal slowing, this tracing would support a partial mechanism for epilepsy, as well as a structural or functional abnormality.  Correlation with imaging is recommended.
