MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Serax, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is perfom1ed in  the lab using standard  10-20 system  of  electrode  placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG.  Photic  stimulation   was performed, as well as hyperventilation  with limited effort.   This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is fairly well organized with a 10 Hz, 35 uV posterior dominant rhythm and generous amounts of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In response to hyperventilation,  there is a subtle increase in the  amplitude noted symmetrically.   Post-hyperventilation,  rare sharp waves at F8 and T4 are observed.  The delta seen from the right temporal region is nearly continuous.   Stage I sleep is achieved briefly and characterized by vertex waves and occasional POSTS.  Photic stimulation elicits a symmetric driving response.
HR: 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
l. Nearly continuous right temporal slowing.
2.  Rare frontotemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This  tracing suggests  a structural  lesion  in  the right temporal  area.    The  frontotemporal  sharp  waves  support  focal  mechanism  for  this patient's epilepsy.
