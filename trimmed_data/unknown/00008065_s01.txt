MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Labetalol,  Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is somewhat somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens the patient is somewhat drowsy. There is a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry with a theta frequency background from the right. In contrast the left hemisphere demonstrates lower voltage, slower 3-5Hz activity and scant beta. Occasional FIRDA is observed.  In addition, in some portions of the record there is left posterior quadrant, somewhat pseudoperiodic delta. Features of drowsiness included increase in background slowing. Over the course of the record when the patient is stimulated the overall background is a more alert pattern  with improvement of the alpha rhythm on the right.
	HR: 	90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Interhemispheric asymmetry.
	2.	Slowing on the left.
	3.	Sharply contoured, somewhat periodic slowing on the left posterior temporal region.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural functional abnormality on the left involving the gray and white matter. The somewhat periodic sharply contoured
delta suggests a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
