MEDICATIONS: Ativan and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat disorganized.  There are portions of the record where the alpha rhythm ranges from 9.5 to 10 Hz, 40 to 50 uV, but there are other portions where the patient is apparently awake and the alpha rhythm slows to 7 Hz.  In addition, there is excess frontal 7 Hz theta activity.  There are some shifting asymmetries in the record, but there are a handful of portions in the record when the EEG is somewhat asymmetric, with a bit more theta identified from the right hemisphere with a mixture of theta and a scant amount of delta.  In addition, there are one or two occasions in which there is shifting asymmetry of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.   
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	A somewhat disorganized background with intermittent slowing in wakefulness.
	Occasional shifting slowing with, at times, what appears to be slower mixed theta and delta from the right hemisphere, particularly the frontal regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The EEG findings described above are non-specific and may be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The subtle focal features described above may be correlated with imaging.
