emergency room: 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is awake with frequent eyeÂ· 
movements. Head rocking and other ICU artifacts are observed. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE REC0RD: The background EEG includes an awake pattern with both some head rocking activity and excess theta and beta. In addition to 
significant artifacts, many of which are picked up ih the temple region, there is also 
some, at least initially, left temporal theta. Other artifacts in this record include IV artifact 
and EKG artifact. Photic stimulation elicits no driving response. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing and paucity of some of the normal waveforms anticipated, 
particularly in the early form of the record.  
2. A question-of an asymmetry with_ potentially sharp waves on the 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the artifacts observed in this critical care ICU 
record a repeat tracing should be performed in the lab prior to discharge.
