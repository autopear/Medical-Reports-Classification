MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside  in the ICU using standard 10-20  system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   RECORD:   In maximum  wakefulness,  there is  a  9  Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit of head rocking artifact and a suggestion of some slowing in the posteriotemporal regions.  There are a handful of normal variants including small sharp spikes of sleep seen in the left centrotemporal region and the right mid-temporal region, but on the right at one point the small sharp spikes are more frequent than is typically accepted for this normal variant. Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.                                      Â·
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1.  A suggestion of some posteriotemporal slowing in drowsiness.
2.   Some epileptiform normal variants, but a suggestion of some waveforms that are seen
more frequent than would be expected in the literature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To more completely define this patient's underlying epileptiform activity; a repeat tracing in the lab with a more prolonged study may. be helpful to differentiate normal variants from true epileptifom1discharges.
