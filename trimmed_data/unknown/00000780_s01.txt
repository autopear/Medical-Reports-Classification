MEDICATIONS: Zyprexa, Dilantin, Paxil.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed, but hyperventilation was not possible because of the language defect.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat poorly organized with a mixture of theta.  There are some sharply contoured bursts seen in the background, particularly in the posterior regions.  There are brief portions of the record where the background appears to be somewhat attenuated in the left frontal region, however, these are not seen in all montages.  Review of the patientâ€™s impedance would not necessarily account for this brief attenuation.  
Photic stimulation elicits brief driving. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Overall poor organization and modest background slowing.
?Left frontotemporal attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter.  To further characterize epileptiform activity, a follow-up EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep could be helpful.
