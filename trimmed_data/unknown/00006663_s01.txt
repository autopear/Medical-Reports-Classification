MEDICATIONS: Lovastatin, Dilantin, Xanax, Doxepin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is relatively drowsy.  When he is maximally awake, the EEG demonstrates an acceptable pattern for an adult of this age with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and overall slowing of the background.  There is a generous amount of beta activity in the background.  
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving with LAMBDA activity.
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  To further characterize this individualâ€™s epilepsy, additional testing may be required.
