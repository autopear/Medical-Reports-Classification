MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lamictal, Geodon, Gabapentin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video BEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity identified from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity or disruption of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in slowing from both hemispheres with greater delta from the left compared to the right. Brief vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep, which is not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally with higher amplitude on the left. 
HR: 84BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal BEG due to: 
1. Subtle focal slowing elicited in the transition to drowsiness and in hyperventilation. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record. The arrhythmic delta activity is not as prominent as one might have anticipated given the trauma history. No previous BEGs were available for comparison.
