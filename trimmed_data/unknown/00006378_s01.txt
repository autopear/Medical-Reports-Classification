MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antihypertensives, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake through stage I sleep record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is fairly symmetric.  There is a 10 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Rare, sharply contoured, irregular  theta with a subtle underlying sharp wave was found in the mid-temporal region in drowsiness.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved. Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  
HR: 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rare, sharply contoured theta activity seen in the left mid-temporal region in drowsiness with underlying sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features seen in this tracing may be partially responsible for the mechanism of seizures in this patient.
