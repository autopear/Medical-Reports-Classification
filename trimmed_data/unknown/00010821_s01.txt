system of electrode placement with 1 EKG. Photic and hyperventilation stimulation were performed. Awake and drowsy study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Drowsiness seen at the beginning of the study with alpha 8.9 Hertz with higher amplitude on the right. Alpha increases to 10 Hertz as the study continues and becomes bilateral. Rhythmic temporal theta is seen which is a normal variant. Beta rhythm can also be seen throughout the record. No stimulation response.
	HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
