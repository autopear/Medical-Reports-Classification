MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta with vertex waves and spindles seen in stage II sleep.   Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling asleep and produces a small driving response.  
HR:  Maximum 132 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The generous beta may be due to this patientâ€™s medications.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
