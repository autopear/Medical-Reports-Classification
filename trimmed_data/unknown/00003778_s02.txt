MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Pipercillin, Vancomycin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is described as 
intubated and unresponsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes primarily a diffuse 
alpha pattern of 10.5 Hz. There is more of an alpha frequency activity in the frontal 
regions than the posterior regions, but it is quite diffuse. There is some variability noted 
and at times this rhythmic, relatively invariant pattern transitions to an 8 Hz pattern. 
HR: 114 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Essentially a pattern of alpha coma. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Alpha coma can be seen in many different context, 
including anoxic injury, trauma, or brain stem pathology. It can also be related to 
medication overdose. The versed drip may play a role on this pattern.
