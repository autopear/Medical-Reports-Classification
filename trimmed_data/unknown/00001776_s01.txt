INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation are performed. 
This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 
lower voltage pattern with 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of beta. Features 
of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. 
Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles. Mild asymmetries are 
noted in stage II sleep with a somewhat lower amplitude pattern in the right 
frontotemporal region than the left. 
HR: 66 bpm 
Minimally abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slight amplitude asymmetry noted in stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Previous EEGs 
were not available for comparison. If epilepsy is an important consideration, an 
additional recording may be of use.
