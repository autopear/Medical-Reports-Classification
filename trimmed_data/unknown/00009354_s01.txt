MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Depakote, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as awake and cooperative.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The activity from the left hemisphere is low voltage, and there is a discernable alpha rhythm although there is excess beta and theta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more rhythmic mixed theta and delta with occasional right mid-to-anterior temporal spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complexes, maximum at T2 and F8.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.   
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Rhythmic slowing from the right temporal region.
	Right anteriotemporal spike and slow wave activity.
	Mild background slowing on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality in the right hemisphere and suggests a temporal localization for this patientâ€™s epilepsy.
