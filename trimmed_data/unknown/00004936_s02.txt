MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Plavix, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 11 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of frontocentral beta activity.  In drowsiness, there is a prominent increase in background theta with occasional vertex waves.   Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  POSTS are identified in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and elicits a brief driving response at intermediate flash frequencies. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  There was occasional snore artifact identified, and this patient was falling asleep in photic stimulation suggesting that this individual may be excessively tired.
