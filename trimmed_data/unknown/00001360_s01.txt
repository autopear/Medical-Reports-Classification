MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Dilaudid
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness background  EEG is poorly organized.  There are portions of the record with data but others with higher amplitude irregular delta, present bilaterally  with shifting asymmetries.   In this shifting delta there is a subtle local maximum sometimes bifrontal but a hint of focality in the right post mid to posterior temporal region.  As the patient drifts off to sleep there is an increase in delta.  As the patient drifts off to sleep there is bit more slow delta on the right as well.  In addition, on one or two occasions triphasic waves are observed.   Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
	HR: 	120 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Marked background  slowing and disorganization.
	2. 	Bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.
	3. 	Shifting arrhythmic delta sometimes a little bit more remarkable on the right.
	4. 	Rare discontinuity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Findings described above are non specific.  Consideration  for a process such as metabolic encephalopathy or other significant diffuse disturbance  of cerebral function is appropriate.   If indicated a follow up study may be   beneficial.
