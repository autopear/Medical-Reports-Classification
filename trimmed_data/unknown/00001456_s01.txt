MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Baclofen, Metoprolol, aspirin, Dilantin, Metformin, and Enalapril.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a reasonably wellorganized background.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is rhythmic background slowing as well as arrhythmic slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  At times, this activity is somewhat sharply contoured.  Later on in the record, when the patient is awake, there is a significant amount of EKG artifact, which endures some degree of the activity in the left anterior temporal region.  
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent rhythmic slowing from the left anterior temporal region, occasionally sharply contoured. 
Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If further characterization of this patientâ€™s epileptiform focus is needed, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep could be helpful.
