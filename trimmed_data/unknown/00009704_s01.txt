MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hertz posterior 
dominant rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a small 
amount of excess theta observed bilaterally. Hyperventilation is performed early on in 
the record increasing theta. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha 
rhythm, followed by vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. 
HR: 60-80 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild excess theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this record. The 
mild background slowing is a nonspecific finding. Correlation with previous studies may 
be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity. Alternatively, a more prolonged sleep 
study may also be of use.
