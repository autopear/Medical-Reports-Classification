MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  With stimulation, she awakens.  A posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz is identified and is reactive.  There is intermittent rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere. Features of drowsiness include bursts of frontal delta, followed by vertex waves.  Sleep is not sustained.
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Background slowing with intermittent bursts of frontal delta. 
	Intermittent focal slowing from the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record or in any of the previous EEGs.  FIRDA is more prominent in this record, and could be due to medical problems rather than CNS pathology.  In this individual with renal failure and bilateral shaking on several occasions, consideration for a non-epileptiform diagnosis may be appropriate.
