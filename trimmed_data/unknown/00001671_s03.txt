MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is generous beta and a small amount of theta.  Head rocking artifact is noted a bit more so on the right compared to the left. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta. 
Excess beta.
A question of some posterior slowing, but unfortunately also some head rocking artifact.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were identified on previous EEGs.  This is the patient's fourth EEG.  None of them have identified epileptiform activity, but posteriorly predominant features have been a consistent pattern for this individual.
