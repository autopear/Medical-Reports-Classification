MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent and in a hard collar. He is somnolent, but interactive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a pattern with generous beta, waxing and waning with beta spindles and slow delta. He is responsive to stimuli. When left to sleep he drifts into stage 2 sleep. As the recording continuous slow artifact is observed compatible with his temperature of 1 01.2. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. A pattern with generalized background slowing and generous beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are compatible with pharmacologic sedation, although the background slowing can also be seen in the context of an intracerebral hemorrhage.
