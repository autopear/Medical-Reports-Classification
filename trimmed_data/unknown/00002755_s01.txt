MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed  in  the lab using  standard  10-20 system of electrode  placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.   Tllis is an awake through stage IIsleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz, 70 uV posterior dominant  rhythm  with  a  small  amount  of  low  voltage,  frontocentral   beta  activity. Drowsiness is characterized  by attenuation of the alpha.  High amplitude ve1iex waves, K complexes,  spindles,  and  POSTS  are identified.  In sleep, there  are a handful  of ve1iex waves  to  the  right  or  left  of midline.    Hyperventilation  produces  a small  amount  of background  slowing and head rocking.  Photic stimulation elicits scant d1iving.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within nom1allimits for age.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION: No epileptifom1 features were identified  in this record. Nom1al EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
