MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG includes a well formed, 
8.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm which is higher amplitude on the right 
compared to the left. There is some subtle theta activity observed in the left frontal 
region compared to the right. This is seen frontotemporally and is intermittent. The 
hyperventilation does not activate the record. Features of drowsiness include slow 
rolling eye movements and an anterior spread of alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does 
not significantly active the record. 
Â· 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Subtle intermittent left frontal theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. These findings 
may be correlated with imaging.
