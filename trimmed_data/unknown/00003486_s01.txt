MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placemen t with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is somewhat slow with excess theta. The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8.6 hertz. The patient drops into stage sleep I with vertex phase followed by arousals. Hyperventilation is remarkable for what is essentially a drowsy pattern. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
Mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL The background slowing described above is non specific and could be due to post-ictal state, medications, or other factors. Additional EEG recording is needed to identify other epileptiform activity.
