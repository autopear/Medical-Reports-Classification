MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tylenol, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is maximally awake, the background EEG is acceptably organized for an adult of this age with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Early in drowsiness, there are bursts of theta activity and the record becomes slightly disorganized. There is also an increase in beta frequency in drowsiness.  Vertex waves are identified in stage __ sleep.  In addition, in the transition to drowsiness, there are bursts of frontally predominant slowing.  The patient seems to be drowsy, intermittently demonstrating bursts of frontally predominant slowing followed by arousal.  
Photic stimulation produces brief driving at intermediate flash frequencies. 
HR:  70 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and early sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG is within normal limits for a subject of this age. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be of use.
