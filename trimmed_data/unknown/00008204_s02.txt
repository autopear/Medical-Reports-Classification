MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, symmetric, and fairly well organized.  There is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a moderate amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The alpha rhythm is attenuated with eye opening.  A breach rhythm with focal slowing is seen in the right frontal and temporal areas.  Occasionally, sharp and sharply contoured activity is seen during drowsiness.  Sleepis evidenced by vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.  The patientâ€™s sleep is frequently interrupted by the noise on the floor.  
EVENTS: No push button events were indicated by the patient.   No seizure activity was identified on the digital video EEG camera.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Breach rhythm with focal slowing in the right frontotemporal area.
Sharp activity and sharply contoured activity in the left frontal and temporal areas. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features recorded during this long-term EEG monitoring are consistent with a pathological process involved in this patient.  It partially supports the mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  However, the patient is not in status.  
If clinically indicated, continuous long-term video EEG may be helpful.
