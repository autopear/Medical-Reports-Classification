MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Digoxin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is reasonably well organized and is in fact higher amplitude than might be expected for an adult of this age.  There is a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is some double phase reversing artifact picked up at P3, but there is some shifting asymmetry with a bit of subtle slow, under riding delta from the right occipital region with underlying delta in that region.  There is also occasional shifting arrhythmic delta.   
HR:  50 to 70 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Intermittent slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm to 7 Hz.
	Shifting arrhythmic delta, at times with a right posterior predominance. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Normal values for subjects of this age are not well defined, but the overall background, particularly when the patient is maximally awake, appears to be well organized.  Consideration for a superimposed process with intermittent slowing of the alpha rhythm is appropriate.  There is some focal delta on the right, which may be correlated with imaging.
