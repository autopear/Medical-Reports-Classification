MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and morphine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 to 8 Hz.  In drowsiness, the background EEG transforms to a pattern more of rhythmic background theta followed by vertex waves.  The patient intermittently arouses and towards the close of the record, with stimulation, arouses and there is a well-defined, 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but there is still a small amount of background theta.  In stage I sleep, vertex waves and POSTS were noted.  Photic stimulation is attempted with some difficulty, but does elicit a bilateral driving response.
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	1.	Mild excess theta and slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are non-specific.  The mild background slowing described above is an anticipated finding for a patient receiving narcotic analgesia.  No previous EEGs were identified.
