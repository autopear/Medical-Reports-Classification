MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Methadone, Ativan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  Cooperation was limited by the patientâ€™s inability to communicate in English. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by mild background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. 
HR:  __ BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
