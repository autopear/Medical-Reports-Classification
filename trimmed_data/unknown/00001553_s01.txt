INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and 
intermittently agitated study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is described as 
somewhat agitated. The background includes generous beta activity seen diffusely with 
superimposed slower delta from the right hemisphere particularly in the central temporal 
region. Stimulation of the patient produces bursts of generalized delta as well as 
movement artifact. As this recording continues, there is an increase in alpha and theta 
frequency activity. A handful of symmetric vertex sharp waves are observed. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to 
1. Replacement of normal background with a beta frequency pattern. 
2. Superimposed focal delta from the right, particularly right central temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features are congruent with this patient's history 
of recent craniotomy. The generalized beta is compatible with the use of 2 
benzodiazepines. No epileptiform features are observed.
