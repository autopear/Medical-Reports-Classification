MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage I sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized and the normal posterior alpha rhythm is not seen.  There is diffuse beta fast activity.  There is nearly continuous right temporal focal slowing as well as an occasional breach rhythm identified.  Post-hyperventilation shows frequent right temporal and occasional right central sharp activity as well as a breach rhythm.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  
Photic stimulation elicits mild driving, right more than left. Also sharp activity in the right central area was seen during photic stimulation.
HR:  56 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Disorganized background with right temporal and central sharp activity, as well as a breach rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breach rhythm is consistent with a craniotomy in this patient.  The focal sharp waves support a  partial mechanism of epilepsy in this patient.  The diffuse beta activity may be secondary to Phenobarbital.
