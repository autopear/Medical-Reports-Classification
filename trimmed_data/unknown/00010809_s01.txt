MEDICATIONS: ?Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a small amount of age appropriate background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing.  LAMBDA waves are seen in wakefulness and POSTS are seen in sleep. 
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits brief  bilateral driving.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits of normal due to: 
	1.	Remarkable degree of theta identified in wakefulness.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be appropriate.
