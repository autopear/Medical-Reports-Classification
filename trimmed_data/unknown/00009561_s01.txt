MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation are preformed. This an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is appropriately organized with 9 hertz, 50 microvolts and posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements, anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and increasing beta. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
	HR:	90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATIONS: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. In that this individual has frequent, relatively severe seizures, additional recording is advised.
