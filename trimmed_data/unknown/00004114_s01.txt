INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are 
preformed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly 
organized with an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity 
on the left which at times transitions to more rhythm delta. Some of the left temporal focal 
slowing is sharply contoured. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha 
rhythm and a more synchronous pattern. Intermittent bursts of bilateral rhythmic delta are 
noted, and on one occasion there is some rhythmic slowing on the right. Hyperventilation 
produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits a driving 
response. 
HR: 72 bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing and disorganization. 
2. Focal slowing on the left in the context of a breach rhythm and at times rhythmic left 
temporal slowing. 
3. Shift in the rhythmic delta activity and on one occasion a bit more sustained focal slowing 
on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there was sharply contoured slowing, there were no 
definitive sharp waves. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The focal 
findings described above may be correlated with imaging.
