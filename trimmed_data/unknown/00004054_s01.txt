MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Dapsone, Benadryle, Amphotericin, Diphenhydramin 
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive, 
eye deviated to the left. Spontaneous movements on the left but aphasic and not 
moving the right. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE The background EEG is abnormal and 
demonstrates a high amplitude periodic sharp wave which sometimes evolves and is 
maximum in the left parietal region with generous field of spread temporal occipital. It 
also has volume conduction to the contralateral hemisphere. Bursts of activity occur 
and then are followed by suppressions. There is no real change in the patient's overall 
clinical status. 
HR: N/A. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Continuous left parietal sharp waves which evolve and are associated with 
clinical features. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is compatible with a complex partial status 
epilepticus. These results were discussed with the clinical team.
