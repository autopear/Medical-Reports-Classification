	MEDICINES: 	Celexa, Dilantin, Lamictal, Motrin, phenobarbital, Risperdal, Sudafed, and Zilactin.
			INTRODUCTION: 	 Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.	Photic stimulation is performed. 	This is an awake and a sleep record. 	No previous EEGs are available for comparison.
				DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 	In apparent wake the background EEG is somewhat disorganized for an adult of this age. 	There is a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. 	The background is sharply contoured and there are 15 asymmetries observed. 	In this sharply
	contoured record, there are rare right centro-temproal sharp waves observed in wakefulness, accentuated as the individual drift into a light sleep state with both discreet and higher amplitude right temporal sharp waves, with a variable phase reversal including T2 or right central temporal. Breech activity is also observed. 	Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, which is slightly at faster frequencies on the right.
HR: 58 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing with a disorganized pattern.
2. Occasional shifting slowing.
3. Right central/central temporal sharp waves.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	 This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. 	A localization related mechanic seizures can be considered.
Because of the at times discreet and at other times high amplitude activity from the right as well as the asymmetric driving response, consideration for a previous craniotomy or breech rhythm is appropriate.
