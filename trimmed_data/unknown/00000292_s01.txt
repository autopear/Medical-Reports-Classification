MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Ativan, Thiamine, Folate, Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 1().20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is resting comfortably 
with nasal cannula oxygen. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly 
slow pattern with low voltage delta and theta. Neuro artifact is observed. There is 
intermittent, slight attenuation of the background. Stimulation of the patient produces an 
increase in theta, but not much of an arousal. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Remarkably slow and low voltage pattern. 
CORRELATION: In the context of a somnolent, but arousable individual, 
this EEG is more compatible with a significant, chronic encephalopathy than acute 
disturbance of cerebral function. No focal nor epileptiform features were 
observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be advised.
