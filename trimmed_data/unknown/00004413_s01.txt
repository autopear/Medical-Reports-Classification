MEDICATION: Tylenol w/ Codeine,  Dilantin, others. ACTIVATION: Photic  Stimulation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  Video  EEG  was performed in the lab using  standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel ofEKG.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD: The  background EEG  is somewhat slow  with a subtle  asynunetry.  The  activity  from  the left  hemisphere is slightly attenuated compared to the right  and easier  to identify a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm on  the left than the right.   In stage  I sleep,  vertex  waves  are noted  and in stage  II sleep,  spindles are noted. Scant driving  was seen in photic stimulation.
HR:  70BPM
IMPR ESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Mild   background   slowing, a  bit  more  prominent in  the  initial  p011ions of  the record,  less so in the later portions of the record
2.   Attenuation of  activity on  the  left  including both  faster  frequency activity  and
some subtle  slowing fiom  the left hemisphere
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:     The   subdural   hematoma  may    account    for   the attenuation  of  activity   on   the  left.     Because  of  this,  if  seizures  are   an  important consideration, a  follow  up  study  should  be  obtained   after  the  subdural hematoma has resolved.
