INTRODUCTION: Digital  Video EEG was performed  at the bedside in the ICU using
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background BEG is somewhat discontinuous with brief bursts of rhythmic  theta frequency activity lasting 1.5-3  seconds in duration. There is a subtle underlying sharp wave focus on the right central or temporal region. Stimulation increases the duration of rhythmic activity.
HR:  72BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal BEG due to:
1.   Discontinuous pattern
2.   An area with  underlying  focal  epileptiform  activity  in the right  frontotemporal
region
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study is performed  four days  after anoxic injury and has a poor prognosis for recovery.  This EEG supports a severe CNS dysfunction.
