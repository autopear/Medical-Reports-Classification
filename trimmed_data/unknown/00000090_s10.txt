MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and 
hyperventilation are performed. The record includes wakefulness and sleep. The 
patient was intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 
Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. 
Generalized asymmetric disorganized with most of the EEG at delta range at 2-3 Hz per 
second with low voltage. Independent bifrontal sharp contour waves were observed. 
Patient has intermittent spontaneous eye movement, eye opening, but has response. 
Stimulate, the patient does not activate his record. At the end of the EEG, low voltage of 
amplitude spikes were also observed on the right frontal area. Photic stimulation elicits, 
hyperventilation elicits, are notable in this record. 
HR: 108 irregular bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Disorganized background slowing. 
2. Low voltage. 
3. Absence of any normal wake forms during wakefulness. 
4. Bifrontal sharp waves at 200 microvolt simple and 2-10Hz per second induration. 
5. Low voltage spikes at right frontal and right mid temporal. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No previous EEG. In this EEG pattern supports the 
diagnosis of severe encephalopathy. The with patient has spontaneous eye opening, 
but with EEG slowing. No seizure was observed during the EEG study.
