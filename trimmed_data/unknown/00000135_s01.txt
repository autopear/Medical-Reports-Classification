MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video BEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the patient is quite  drowsy  with  stage  II sleep  and  vertex  waves;  however,  with  stimulation,  brief alerting is identified with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1.  Excess drowsiness.
2.   Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION: No epileptiform  features were identified in this record. In this  individual  with  serious  seizures  and  alcohol  abuse,  a follow-up  BEG may  be valuable to assess risk of recurrent seizures.
