MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there a 9 Hz, 50 to 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The background is mildly slow and disorganized for age. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in the amplitude and hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a discrete driving response.   
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Mild background slowing and disorganization for a subject of this age. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a non-specific pattern consistent with the patientâ€™s postictal period. No epileptiform features were seen.
