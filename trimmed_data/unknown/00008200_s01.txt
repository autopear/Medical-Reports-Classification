MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Nifedical. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrodes and 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness, the patient's EEG shows 
background disorganization with alpha around 1 0 Hz. There is also evidence for a little 
bit of background theta. Photic stimulation elicits no driving. The patient does not have 
any episodes of drowsiness during the record. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background disorganization. 
2. Background theta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are seen during the record. Mild 
background slowing and disorganization would need to be evaluated clinically.
