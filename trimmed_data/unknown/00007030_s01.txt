INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Brief epochs of stage I sleep include vertex waves. Other features as the patient transitions in and out of sleep
include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation is performed while the
patient finally slips into stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.
	HR:	54 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be helpful.
