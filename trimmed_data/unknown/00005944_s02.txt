MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video  EEG  is performed  in  the  lab using  standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background  EEG is well orgm1ized with   a  10  Hz,  50  uV  posterior   dominant   rhytlm1.       Stage   II  sleep  is characterized by vertex  waves, K  complexes,  spindles,  and POSTS.   Hyperventilation produces  a small  amount  of background  slowing.  Photic  stimulation  elicits  LAMBDA and a driving response.
HR:  60BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within n01mallimits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform  features were identified in this record.  Nom1al EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
