MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Famotidine, Lovenox, Cefepime, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is intubated and somewhat responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes primarily at 5-6 hertz theta pattern. There is some head rocking artifact in the posterior region and a little bit more delta in the posterior regions. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response with motor activity. 
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG with: 
Theta background. 
Some posteriorly predominant slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates reactivity and variability which is a positive prognostic finding following anoxic insult.
