MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dilantin, methadone, Trazodone, Trileptal. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is sharply contoured with a 9 Hz, 30 to 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  MU rhythm is identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  Wicket activity is seen as the patient becomes drowsy.  Other features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, eliciting some background slowing.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  
HR:  66 to 70 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the history described above, a repeat EEG performed in the fasting state following sleep deprivation is recommended to evaluate potential epileptiform activity.
