INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with excess theta and an alpha rhythm of 7 Hz to 8 Hz. Shifting slowing is identified in the posterior regions and occasionally in the right hemisphere. In a transition to sleep, bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing are observed. 
HR: 78bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
2. Background slowing. 
3. Disorganization.
 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The pattern described above may be due to the patient's lifelong epilepsy or to an age related process. If further characterization of the seizures is needed, a more prolonged EEG in the Lab is suggested. Alternatively, comparison with his previous EEGs over the course of decades could provide helpful information.
