MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake.  Dilantin was discontinued the previous day. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.  Underneath this, the background is slow.  There is a glimpse of an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but at times there is posterior slowing, a bit more remarkable from the left than the right.   
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited, but abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The amount of muscle artifact in this EEG may well have obscured focal features.  No epileptiform abnormalities were seen.  If further information is needed, a repeat tracing when the patient is a bit more comfortable is recommended.
