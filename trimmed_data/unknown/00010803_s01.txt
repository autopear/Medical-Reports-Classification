MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel of EKG.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG in maximum wakefulness has an alpha of about 9 Hz, which is of low amplitude.   
The patient quickly drifts off into sleep, which is characterized by slowing of the background and vortex phase. 
Hyperventilation does not reveal any abnormalities.  The patient becomes drowsy right after hyperventilation.   
Heart rate 66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
