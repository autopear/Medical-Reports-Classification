MEDICATIONS: 
Pentoxifylline. 
INTRODUCTION: 
standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Photic stimulation was performed. There 
are brief portions of the record when the patient is awake when the 
overall background is symmetric with a discernible low voltage alpha 
rhythm and generous theta. Other portions of the record when the 
patient appears to be awake demonstrate a low voltage, somewhat more 
featureless pattern with theta frequency activity. Spontaneous 
arousals are observed. As the patient becomes drowsy there is a small 
amount of shifting flowing. Photic stimulation does not elicit a 
driving response. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Intermittently low voltage pattern while awake to shifting slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this 
record. Given the magnitude of the lesions observed on MRI, these EEG 
findings are quite unimpressive.
