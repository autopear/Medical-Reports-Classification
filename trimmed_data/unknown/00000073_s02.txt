MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a mixture of alpha 
and theta activity with intra hemispheric asymmetry with lower voltage on the left side. 
Occasional has right posterior temporal sharp wave was present. Drowsiness is 
characterized by slow eye roaming. At the end of the EEG, a burst of irregular delta 
activity on the right side was observed. Stimulating the patient elicits alerting. 
Heart rate 84 BPM, irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram due to: 
1. Generalized background slow. 
2. Intrahemispheric asymmetry with lower voltage on the left side. 
3. Right posterior temporal sharp. 
4. Burst of irregular delta on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizure observed during this study. This EEG has 
improved compared to the previous EEG on January 21, 2008. Many of the features 
described above were present in the previous EEG. This may be the result of prolonged 
effect from his medications. He has normal morphology of sleep. The patient is more 
arousable today, but behaviorally, somnolent.
