INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG  is performed in  the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode  placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is  performed. This is  an  awake and  asleep record.
	DESCRIPTION   OF  THE  RECORD:	In wakefulness,  background EEG
demonstrates a rhythmic, reasonably well organized  pattern.  There is  a
7  Hz,   50 microvolt posterior  dominant  rhythm.  There  is rare, shifting slowing. This is  accentuated as the patient  becomes drowsy. Vertex waves are  observed in  stage  1  sleep.  Photic stimulation does not activate  the record.
HR:   84 bpm
	IMPRESSION:	Mildly  abnormal  EEG due  to:
	1.	Mild generalized  background  slowing.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in either of the  EEG's in  2007.  Unfortunately,  after a one month search,  the
2003  EEG  results  have not bee identified.
