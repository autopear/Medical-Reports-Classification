MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Ancef, Dilantin, and Erythromycin.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and low voltage.  There is a one single channel electrode on T5 to O1, which showed sharply contoured, high amplitude theta or delta and sometime triphasic-like activity throughout the record.  This may be due to technical problems.  At the time, the left temporal focal slowing was also observed.  There is an 11 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient falls to sleep. Sleep is characterized by vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.  
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Single channel sharply contoured, high amplitude activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This single channel sharply contoured, high amplitude activity may be due to a technical problem.  No clinical seizures were observed on the video camera.  A repeat EEG to clarify this single channel finding is recommended.
