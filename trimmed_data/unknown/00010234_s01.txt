MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Trileptal, Topiramate, and Protonix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.  The patient underwent hyperventilation and experienced a severe headache subsequently, which required the house officer to provide an assessment in the EEG lab. The patient has a bitemporal craniotomy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  What is likely a bilateral breach rhythm is identified in the centrotemporal regions bilaterally.  In this context, there is a single left temporal sharp wave in wakefulness.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in slowing of the background.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing noted even in the awake background.  At 11:53, after hyperventilation has concluded, the patient reports a headache, which she describes as increasingly severe, is restless, and pulls at her legs.  No changes are noted in the EEG with this headache.  There is no increase in focal slowing or beta, and no epileptiform features were identified.  
HR:  72 to 90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Bursts of shifting slowing. 
	Excess beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: With only a single sharp wave, this cannot be considered definitely epileptogenic.  The beta activity could be due to medications, anxiety, or discomfort.  The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
