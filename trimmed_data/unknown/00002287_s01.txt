MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antibiotics, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.  During the recording, the patient is confused and sleeping.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and disorganized.  The left hemisphere demonstrates fairly continuous, relatively rhythmic delta activity, maximum in the frontal and temporal regions.  Activity from the left is higher amplitude than the right.  When the patient is drowsy, decreased muscle artifact and intrahemispheric asymmetry were identified with decreased amplitude in the right hemisphere.  After the patient is awakened, a 5 Hz, 40 V slow alpha rhythm is identified. 
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing. 
Continuous rhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere.
	3.	Increased amplitude in the left hemisphere. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG demonstrates a severe disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.  The increased amplitude in the left hemisphere can be seen after a craniotomy or skull defect.  The continuous arrhythmic delta activity supports a structural abnormality.  No epileptiform discharges were identified in this tracing.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a follow-up EEG is recommended.
