MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Compazine 
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation and 
hyperventilation were completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background is high amplitude, youthful in 
appearance with 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low 
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Posterior slow waves of youth were observed. 
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record. It produces some bursts of 
bilateral slowing but in addition it also accentuates a solid, underlying left anterior 
temporal sharp wave. In addition, just prior to the hyperventilation, a left anterior 
temporal sharp wave is observed. Features of drowsiness including increase in 
background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. 
HR: 104 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Subtle, left anterior temporal sharp waves with associated focal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for 
epilepsy. Correlation with physical examination, seizure type and imaging is advised.
