MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 
10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an 
awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 hertz 60 
microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low 
voltage, frontal and central beta activity. Features of drowsiness 
include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Occasional posterior 
waves of youth are observed in the waking background. Hyperventilation 
was performed with good effort producing a small amount of background 
slowing and an increase in amplitude. Photic stimulation does not 
elicit driving. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or eleptiform seizures are observed in 
this record in this individual with nocturnal seizures. Additional EEG 
recording is recommended with additional hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation as well as extended sleep to search for epileptiform 
activity in this individual with a history of head trauma. No focal 
features were observed.
