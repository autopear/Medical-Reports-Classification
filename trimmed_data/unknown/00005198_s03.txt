INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This EEG is challenged by significant muscle and motion artifact in an intubated, more or less awake individual who is moving about continuously. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a continuous pattern of theta with generous beta and muscle artifact. Epileptiform abnormalities are observed in this record including independent, primarily right frontal or hemispheric high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes. Rare independent similar complexes in the left and vertex sharp waves seen when the individual is not in stage 1 sleep. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Right hemispheric spike and slow wave complexes. 
3. Independent left frontal central spike and slow wave activity. 
4. Vertex sharp waves in an awake state. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Background slowing supports an underlying encephalopathy which can be due to medications or the anoxic insult the day prior to this EEG. Comparison with previous EEGs is important in assessing the epileptiform activity identified today.
