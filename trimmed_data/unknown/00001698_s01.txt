INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is described as responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric 
asymmetry. The activity is actually slower on the right in comparison to the left. There is an 
alpha rhythm observed bilaterally, but it is 9 Hz on the left and is sometimes slower on the right. 
In addition, there is a right central temporal and at times posterior temporal sharp and slow 
wave complex which is clearly discernible in this sharply contoured background. As the patient 
becomes a bit more relaxed the intrahemispheric asymmetry becomes more prominent with 
slowing observed in the right hemisphere before the left and arrhythmic delta, particularly in the 
right posterior temporal region. Sharp waves are observed in the record, and as the patient 
transitions to a sleepier state has a field of spread which involves the central and posterior 
temporal regions. 
HR: 78-90 bpm, irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere. 
2. Disruption of faster frequency on the right. 
3. Sharp waves in the right hemisphere mid to posterior temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If this individual is thought to have aphasia, additional evaluation 
for localization of language in the right hemisphere may be appropriate.
