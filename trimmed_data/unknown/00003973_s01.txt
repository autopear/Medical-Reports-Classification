MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the record is high amplitude 
as can be anticipated in a child of this age with an 8.5-Hz, 75-mV amplitude alpha 
rhythm, higher amplitude on the left than the right with age-appropriate posterior 
subwaves of youth. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing bursts 
of occipitally predominant rhythmic slowing. Following this as the patient becomes 
drowsy, there is an increase in background theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral 
drivingÂ· 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified in this 
record. Correlation with previous study is advised.
