MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Cisatracurium. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is suspended in a 
device and is under a cooling blanket. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG Is markedly suppressed. 
There is no reactivity. There is no variability. An artifact is picked up in the right occipital 
region every 2.6 seconds. 
HR: 96bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to 
1. Suppression of normal cerebral activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports severe disturbance of cerebral 
function. Important clinical factors include phenobarbital level and exposure to other 
sedative agents.
