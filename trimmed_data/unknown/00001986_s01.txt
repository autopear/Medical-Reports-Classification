MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Serax, Hydralazine, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes a drowsy pattern with a brief alpha and then excess background theta. Multiple snore arousals are seen. There are also multiple PVCs noted. Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  In sleep, there are a handful of shifting asymmetries. 
HR:  90 BPM, occasionally irregular with frequent PVCs.
	IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Excess background slowing.
Shifting slowing in sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. The features described above may be correlated with imaging.  The snore arousals may be seen in the context of an underlying sleep disturbance. These may be particularly worrisome given the EKG abnormalities described above.
