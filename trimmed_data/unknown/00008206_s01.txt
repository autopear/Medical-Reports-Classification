MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Glucophage, Zoloft, and calcium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.    
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a 7 Hz, 30 to 60 V dominant rhythm.  Intermittent bilateral as well as unilateral right focal slowing is characterized by frontal theta and delta.  There is a right frontal breech demonstrated by increased beta and increased amplitude of theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are more prominent bursts of frontal slowing and a breech on the right.  Although the EEG is abnormal, it is nearly symmetric and well organized at times. Hyperventilation produces right frontal delta.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.  There is no EEG change at the time of twitching.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bilateral as well as unilateral focal slowing characterized by frontal theta or delta.
Right frontal breech with increased beta and increased amplitude of the delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing suggests an underlying structural problem most likely affecting both frontal hemispheres. No sharp waves could be identified. A follow-up EEG during deeper stages of sleep may be useful in identifying focal epileptiform activity given the breech rhythm.
