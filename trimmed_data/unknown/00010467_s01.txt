MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tylenol, Protonix, Vancomycin, Propofol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, low to medium amplitude with a mixture of beta and theta frequency activity. Shifting slowing is observed. Stimulation produces an alerting response with some bursts of focal delta on the left. Beta frequency activity is noted in the center region. Eye movement artifact is noted and there are questionable posts or lambda waves in the background. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mixed frequency generalized background slowing. 
2. Shifting slowing with a question of focal slowing on the left central region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. These findings may be correlated with the clinical picture and imaging.
