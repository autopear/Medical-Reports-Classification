MEDICATIONS: Ativan drip, Dilantin, aspirin, Digoxin, Versed, Labetalol, and check tech sheet.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and unresponsive during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, symmetric with diffuse beta activity.  Stimulation of the patient producedâ€¦.. 
HR:  136 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Low voltage and diffuse beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The diffuse beta activity is consistent with barbiturate or benzodiazepine use. No focal nor epileptiform features were seen in this record.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a follow-up EEG when the patient is stable after being extubated may be useful.
