MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Insulin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the emergency room 
using standard 1 0-20 system of electrode placement. The patient is intubated and 
somewhat responsive. He now has spontaneous movements, grimacing and biting 
down on the endotracheal tube, but is not awake. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly abnormal. The 
normal background has been replaced with a background rich in theta and delta. 
Spontaneous arousals are observed. There is frequent left temporal focal slowing, and 
a periodic left temple sharp wave. This has a generous field of spread in the 
frontotemporal regions, and more of a sharp component at F7. It does not build up. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent left periodic sharp wave with periodic delta seen almost continuously 
through the record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The sharp wave described above does not evolve. The 
patient demonstrates spontaneous arousals. In this context, this activity may be 
considered post-ictal rather than ongoing ictal, but additional evaluation is essential to 
make sure that clinical seizures are not overlooked.
