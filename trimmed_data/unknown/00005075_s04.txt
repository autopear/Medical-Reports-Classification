ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed  in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode  placement  with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: Demonstrates   a  generalized  slow  background with theta activity noted on the right more than the left.  Wakefulness  showed 7 Hz, 50uV disrupted on the right.   Phase reversal is in the intratemporal  spike.   Drowsiness  is characterized  by increased  focal slowing on the right.  Photic stimulation  elicits driving.
HR:  60BPM.
IMPR ESSION: Abnormal  BEG due to:
1.   Generalized  slow background
2.   Right temporal sharp waves
3.   Increased focal slowing on the right
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:    This  BEG  supports  a  structural   abnormality.    No changes from his previous EEG.
