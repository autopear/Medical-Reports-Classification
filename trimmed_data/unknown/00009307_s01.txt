MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Depakote. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is of medium amplitude.  In some portions of the record, there is a well-formed 7 to 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but during other portions of the record, there is more synchronous, rhythmic background slowing.  There is also some arrhythmic slowing identified intermittently in the left anterior temporal region with one or two sharply contoured discharges in that region.  These are best exemplified using a T1/T2 montage.  
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  In photic, there are some bursts of shifting, sharply contoured slowing in the temporal regions.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a small increase in the synchronicity of the background. 
HR:  56 to 70 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Sharply contoured slowing seen from the temporal regions primarily on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized background slowing is non-specific but supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  This may be due to a toxic, metabolic, or postictal pattern.  Because of the sharply contoured slowing, consideration for an underlying epileptiform disorder would be appropriate.
