MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is low voltage with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 8 Hz.  There is a fair amount of background theta.  There is a suggestion of a breach rhythm, which is picked up primarily in the right temporal region and there is some shifting, right or left temporal theta.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing hypersynchronous, high amplitude theta activity and then hyperventilation is terminated early. Following this, there is a wicket activity picked up from either temporal region followed by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  As the patient reaches sleep, the breach rhythm is apparent as is some EKG artifact, but there is a clear T2 sharp wave seen in the transition to stage II sleep.  More prolonged stage II sleep is symmetric. 
Photic stimulation is performed with the patient drifting in and out of sleep.  There is some photoelectric artifact and minimal driving.   
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Right temporal spike and slow wave activity identified in the transition to sleep. 
Occasional right temporal focal slowing with a breach rhythm.
Independent, occasional left temporal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a partial or localization mechanism for epilepsy, which is ipsilateral to the patientâ€™s lesion, however, consideration for a process which also involves the left hemisphere would be appropriate given the temporal focal slowing.
