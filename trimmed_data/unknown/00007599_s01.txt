MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly disorganized and continuous with mild interhemispheric asymmetry.  There is an excessive amount of theta activity in the left hemisphere. There is an 8 to 9 Hz, 25 to 30 u posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eyes opened.   As the tracing continues, intermittent left anterior temporal delta as well as occasional left anterior sharp activity is seen.  Sleep was not achieved in this record.  
Photic stimulation did not activate the record. 
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mildly disorganized and slow background with interhemispheric asymmetry on the left.
Left anterior quadrant focal slowing with occasional sharp activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal findings in this tracing are indicative of an underlying pathological process which is consistent with a structural lesion due to AVM in this patient.  It also supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.
