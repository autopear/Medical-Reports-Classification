	MEDICATIONS: 	None.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the laboratory using the standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of electrocardiogram.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness background EEG is wellÂ­ organized with 9 Hertz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage and central beta activity. Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record producing an increase in the amplitude of the background. Following this, in relaxed wakefulness, both alpha and Mu activities are seen but testing is not performed to confirm this. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR: 72 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Normal awake EEG.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	No focal or epileptiform features are observed in this record. Multiple normal variants such as alpha, Mu and posts were identified. To further characterize this
individual's epilepsy, a more prolonged record capturing  sleep is
advised.
