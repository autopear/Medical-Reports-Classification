MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, and multiple antibiotics. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Of note, the patient experienced multiple spells while the EEG was being hooked up, but none during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes diffuse background beta.  The patient intermittently spontaneously arouses with an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta and delta from the central regions as the patient reaches stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles. 
HR:  __ BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal: 1.  Excess beta.  2. Mild background slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features.  Consider repeat study to capture on of patientâ€™s typical behaviors.
