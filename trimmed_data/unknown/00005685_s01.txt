MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly slow with a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Occasional shifting arrhythmic temporal delta are seen.  There are rare, right temporal sharp waves identified on two occasions. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing.
Rare, right temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The occurrence of right temporal sharp waves supports a partial mechanism for this patientâ€™s seizure.  The mild background slowing and occasional temporal shifting arrhythmic delta is a non-specific finding and supports an additional diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  This can be seen in numerous conditions such as metabolic or toxic degenerative processes or a postictal state.  Correlation with neuroimaging is recommended.
