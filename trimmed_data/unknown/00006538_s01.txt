	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, Relpax, Lexapro, Cyclobenzaprine and Depakote.
	INTRODUCTION: 	This is a digital video EEG done in the lab. The EEG
was performed with a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel lead of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE   RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized. Unfortunately, as the record continues there are increasing amounts of muscle artifact. There is a suggestion of a low voltage, 9-
10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral
beta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with POSTS observed on one occasion. Hyperventilation  is performed with good effort producing a great deal of head rocking artifact but no definite slowing. Photic stimulation elicits generous bilateral driving.
	HR:	60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: 	EEG within normal limits.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	Due to the technical limitations described above with excessive muscle artifact as well as the absence of stage II sleep, a repeat study is essential to more completely characterize epileptiform activity.
