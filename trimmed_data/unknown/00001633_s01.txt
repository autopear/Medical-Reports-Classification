MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Advair. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was 
performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake with a 
10 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, 
frontocentral beta activity. The patient is slowly rocking her head from side to side as the 
EEG begins, which produces some head rocking artifact. Features of drowsiness include 
slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and then arousal. The 
technologist encourages the patient to get comfortable and fall asleep, but she continues 
to rock her head back and forth. Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and 
spindles. In sleep, the head rocking is not identified. 
Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response. 
HR: 86 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this 
record. The head rocking activity was not associated with a change in the EEG.
Consideration for a disorder other than epilepsy may be appropriate.
