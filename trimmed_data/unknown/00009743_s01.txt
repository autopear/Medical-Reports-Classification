MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Dilantin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient who is uncomfortable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  There is a 9 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient rapidly drifts into a drowsy state with slow rolling eye movements, slowing of the alpha rhythm, and an increase in background beta. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. 
HR:  58 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
