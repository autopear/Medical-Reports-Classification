MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Plavix, aspirin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using 
standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of 
EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG 
is well-organized with 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. 
Drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of background 
slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. 
HR: 96 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are 
identified. This information may be valuable during the planned 
carotid surgery.
