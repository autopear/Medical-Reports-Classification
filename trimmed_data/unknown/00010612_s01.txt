MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and antibiotics.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is perfom1ed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode  placement  with one channel  of EKG. The child is in stage If sleep throughout much of the record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were perfom1ed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The vast majority of this EEG demonstrates stage II sleep,  with  vertex  waves  and  K  complexes  seen  in  stage II sleep.    Arousals  are associated with a 9 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Photic stinmlation elicits brief bilateral driving.   HyPerventilation is not particularly successful  given this child's somnolence.
H  R:  96BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.      Normal   EEG   does   not   exclude   the   diagnosis   of   epilepsy.      If  further characterization  of this child 's epilepsy  is important, additional studies  or comparison with her childhood studies is appropriate.
