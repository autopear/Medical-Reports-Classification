MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage I sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is some slightly irregular temporal bursts seen with some shifting asymmetries left and right.  On one or two occasions, there is a T1 phase reversal.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Of note, there is some electrode artifact picked up in the T2 electrode in drowsiness. 
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces some background slowing as well as a single burst of sharply contoured left temporal delta activity. Photic stimulation elicits symmetric driving.

	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Irregular, shifting temporal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a clear burst of sharply contoured delta activity from the left temporal region and some suspicious sharp activity in drowsiness.  Some of this resembles wicket and with a combination of the electrode artifact and the wicket, no definitive conclusions regarding clearly epileptiform activity can be made.  In comparison to a previous EEG in April 2004, the previous EEG was normal.  A repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep would be helpful to more clearly evaluate this individual for seizures.
