MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a 7 Hz, 30 V theta pattern.  A posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 8 Hz is identified.  A breach rhythm is difficult to discern at the midline or left hemisphere.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is slightly higher amplitude delta activity on one or two occasions on the right compared to the left  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in frontally predominant beta activity.  Photic stimulation does not elicit driving.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was seen in this record.  No definite epileptiform features have been seen in either of this patientâ€™s previous studies.  The background slowing is similar to one of his two previous studies.  If further characterization of his epileptiform activity is needed, an additional EEG recording may be useful.
