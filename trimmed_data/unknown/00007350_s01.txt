MEDICATION: Codeine,  Labetalol, and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was perforn1ed at the bedside using standard 10-
20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is drowsy, sometimes awake and at other times, uncomfortable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates  a continuous pattern.   The activity  from the left hemisphere  is relatively  low voltage.   At times, the patient ale1is briefly and the activity from the left is a theta pattern with some underlying delta.  There is a clear intrahemispheric  asymmetry identified with breech rhythm seen on the  right,  more  arrhythmic   delta  activity  from  the  right  than  the  left  and  overall,  a disruption  of  faster  frequency  activity.    However,  at  times, as  the  patient  becomes drowsy, there is a bit more beta activity noted from the right.  There is clear variability in the record.  At times, there is an increase in delta with frontally predominant  delta.
HR:  104BPM
IMPRESSION: Abnormal BEG due to:
1.   Focal slowing from .the right hemisphere maximun1 in the temporal regions
2.   Generalized backgrOlmd slowing
3.  Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right
CLINICAL CORRELATION:    This EEG  supports  a structural  or functional abnormality  and is congruent with this patient's recent neurosurgical  history.  In addition, a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function is supported  as one might expect in the context of  acute   postoperative  neurosurgical   patient.      No   epileptiform   features   are  seen. Additional EEG recording may be helpful.
