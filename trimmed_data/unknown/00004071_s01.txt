MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, ___ medicine, Haldol, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous but poorly organized.  The normal posterior alpha rhythm is rarely seen.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Continuous, periodic sharp activity was seen at C4, T6, and O2 areas without clinical correlates.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
High amplitude and disorganized background.
Continuous, periodic sharp activity in the left centrotemporal and posterior regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This unusually abnormal pattern is suggestive of a cerebral dysfunction.  The focal features of the continuous, periodic sharp activity on the left may be suggestive of an underlying pathological process, and the high amplitude and disorganized background may be suggestive of deeper nuclei in the midline structure.  No clinical seizures were recorded. If clinically indicated and if the patientâ€™s scalp permits, long-term EEG monitoring may be able to provide further information.
