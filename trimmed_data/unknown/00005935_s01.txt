MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Topamax, and antibiotics.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates some marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is modestly slow with a mixture of theta and smaller amounts of delta, but there is a well-defined and reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates primarily rhythmic theta with smaller amounts of delta, although at times a posterior dominant rhythm can be identified.  There are intermittent sharp waves identified from the left hemisphere.  These demonstrate variable maximum including left frontotemporal, anterior temporal, or frontal.  They range in amplitude from medium to high amplitude and are accompanied by generous after going slow waves.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  This is a dynamic record, and by the close of the record the activity from the right hemisphere is nearly normal and the left hemisphere is significantly less slow.  
HR:  85 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal and temporal sharp waves. 
Left hemispheric focal slowing.
Intermittent background slowing on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a focal mechanism for this patientâ€™s seizures, as well as a structural or functional abnormality on the left involving both gray and white matter.  The dynamic pattern with improvement towards the close of the record may be part of a process in a patient who is overall improving.
