MEDICATIONS: Insulin, aspirin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was 
performed. The patient was cooperative. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite a great deal of muscle and movement 
artifact, there is a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low 
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye 
movements. At the close of the record, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is some 
subtle focal slowing from the right. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. 
HR: 96BPM. 
Il\1PRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: 
l. Subtle right-sided slowing seen only in drowsiness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record. 
These findings may be correlated with clinical exam, history, and imaging.
