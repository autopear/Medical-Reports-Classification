MEDICATIONS: Dilatin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well 
organized, slightly low voltage with a 10-Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Hyperventilation 
is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude in the 
background. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation 
elicits bilateral driving. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits. 
CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. If 
additional information is needed, repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is 
advised.
