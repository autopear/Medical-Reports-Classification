MEDICATIONS: Labetalol, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were perfonned.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake, but not particularly active. The overall background is one of theta with smaller amounts of delta. There   are   spontaneous  arousals  noted  with  richer  theta  frequency  activity  seen particularly on the left.
The most notable feature in the record, is the high an1plitude, periodic sharp complex from the right temporal region with a generous field of spread, maximum in the frontotemporal regions.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in the richness of the background, but it does seem to attenuate the epileptiform activity.
HR:  72BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Nearly continuous periodic sharps from the right.
2.  Mild-to-moderate background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Positive features in this record include the attenuation of the sharp waves with tactile stimulation suggesting that this is an interictal rather than an ictal finding.
