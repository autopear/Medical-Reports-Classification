MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The technologist notes that the patient’s hair is extremely matted and electrode placement is difficult.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a somewhat challenging EEG.  There are portions of the record when the patient is awake where there is a 9.6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but the background is somewhat disorganized.  Despite muscle and movement artifact, there is a suggestion of underlying slowing from the right central region.   Features of drowsiness include a decrease in muscle and movement artifact.  When the patient is motorically active, there is a bit more eye movement artifact on the left compared to the right.
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
	A modest amount of background disorganization and theta.
	A question of an asymmetry from the right central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Reviewing the EEG, this patient is more confused and agitated than one might expect given the degree of background slowing.  It is more supportive of a chronic process than an acute one, particularly in a subject of this age.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Focal features in this study may have been under recognized due to the patient’s agitation.
