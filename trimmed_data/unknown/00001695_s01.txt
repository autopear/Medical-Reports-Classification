MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Pantoprazole 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This Is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an intrahemispheric asymmetry. When the patient is maximally awake, there is an 8.5 to 9 Hz alpha rhythm on the left with a small amount of excess theta. A skull defect is noted on the right with some head rocking artifact, focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in beta activity seen most prominently on the right and a subtle, C4 sharp wave is noted in the context of a breach rhythm. The epileptiform activity is primarily right centrotemporal.
HR: 104 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild background slowing on the left. 2. More continuous focal slowing from the right. 3. Right centrotemporal sharp waves seen most prominently in sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right involving both gray and white matter. In addition, the epileptiform activity is in this region. Mild background slowing on the left is noted as might be expected in an individual with recent repetitive seizures.
