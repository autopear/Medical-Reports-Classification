MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Baclofen, Ativan, Hydralazine, and Plavix. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and described as comatose. He is stimulated during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   RECORD:   The  background EEG  demonstrates  a  low voltage, slow pattern with a subtle intrahemispheric asymmetry. The background appears lower voltage and a bit more suppressed on the right compared to the left.   There is variability in the record, and there is some low voltage beta, theta, and even alpha frequency activity.
HR: 110 BPM, irregular. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Replacement of normal background with a lower voltage, mixed frequency but slow pattern.
. 2.  Superimposed asymmetry with more attenuation on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: Correlation with imaging and exam may be important, particularly if there is an  underlying subdural hematoma on the right.
