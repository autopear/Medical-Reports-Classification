MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly disorganized with excessive theta activity.  There is an 8 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity in either temporal region were also recognized.  This activity increased during hyperventilation. Occasional left frontocentral sharply contoured slow activity was identified.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the background with some vertex waves.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  
HR: 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mildly disorganized background with excessive theta activity.
Bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity in either temporal region.  
Occasional left frontocentral sharply contoured slow activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The mild background disorganization and slowing may be suggestive of an underlying process in this patient due to previous head trauma and chronic alcohol use.  The left frontocentral sharply contoured slow activity may be partially responsible for the mechanism of epilepsy in this patient.  No epileptiform activity was seen in this nor in the prior study.
