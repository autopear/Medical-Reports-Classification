MEDICATIONS: Zofran, Dilaudid, Tylenol, Lorazepam, ASA Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10 20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is awake and drowsy. The overall 
pattern is low voltage but it is consistently lower voltage on the left compared to the 
right. There is a glimpse of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and there is a small 
amount of theta. 
HR: 60bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Mild excess theta. 
3. An intrahemispheric asymmetry with an amplitude asymmetry on the left compared 
to the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In that this is a bedside recording, the significance of the 
amplitude asymmetry is somewhat uncertain. A repeat tracing in the lab now that the 
patient is extubated may provide more information.
