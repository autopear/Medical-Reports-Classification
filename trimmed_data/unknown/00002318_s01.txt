MEDICATIONS: Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and fairly well organized.  There is a 9 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is significant muscle movement artifact.  Hyperventilation increases theta activity.  Post-hyperventilation, the patient becomes drowsy and LAMBDA activity is seen.  Photic stimulation elicits driving. 
HR: 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal features or epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing.  Normal EEG does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy.  Continuous long-term video EEG monitoring may be able to reveal further information of the seizure activity in this patient.
