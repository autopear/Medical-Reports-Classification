INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is abnormal. There are some portions where the record is well organized with a 9.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm better identified on the right than the left. EEG demonstrates  maximal optimal organizations. There is at least subtle focal slowing from the left. There is sharply contoured delta on the left with a phase reversal at T3 and occasionally  with a generous field of spread or change in amplitude and involvement of T1 and/or T5. There are also bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta and bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in the rhythmic delta followed by vertex waves. Spindles are observed in stage 2 sleep. Hyperventilation produces some hypersynchronous  slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving although the patient is drifting off to stage 2 sleep. There are some suspicious wave forms at FP2,F4.
	HR: 	54 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Prominent left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves.
	2. 	Bursts of FIRDA.
	3. 	Shifting slowing.
	4. 	Intermittent focal slowing from the left.
	5. 	Question right frontal central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The bihemispheric features may be part of this patient's bihemispheric, water shed infarcts. The sharp waves and sharply contoured slowing
suggested on going predisposition to seizures. Compared to previous studies, the background has improved.
