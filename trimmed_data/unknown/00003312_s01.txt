INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation. The patient has very frequent blinking. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal. It is diffusely slow with a posterior dominant rhythm of 6 hertz. There is excess theta and shifting arrhythmic delta activity which is sharply contoured. It is present bilaterally, but more prominent in the left temporal region. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in delta. 
HR: 72 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing, improving by the end of the record. 
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta. 
3. Sharply contoured delta, left temporal greater than right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are nonspecific, but supported by hemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. Contributing factors can include a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as postictal state.
