MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Protonix., Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow throughout.  There is no focal asymmetry. His alpha rhythm is  7Hz. There are episodes of shifting slowness.
The patient drifts into sleep with vertex waves, but does not have continuous sleep.
	HR:	84bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Slow background.
	2. 	Shifting slowing.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: There was no epileptiform activity seen on this EEG. The
background slowing could  be  due  to known brain pathology or Dilantin toxicity.
