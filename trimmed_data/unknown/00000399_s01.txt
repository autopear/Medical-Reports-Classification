INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE Background EEG includes a dynamic pattern. Some 
portions are primarily theta frequency activity which is relatively rhythmic. Other portions of the 
record are disrupted by bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominate high amplitude delta activity 
with bursts lasting 3-5 seconds. On occasion this activity is asymmetric, higher amplitude more 
rhythmic on the left and slower and more arrhythmic on the right. The overall activity is sharply 
contoured but there are no definitive sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle 
but also some faster frequency activity. 
HR: 60 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Background slowing. 
2. Bursts of rhythmic and arrhythmic delta activity with at times somewhat asymmetric clinical 
correlation. 
CLINICAL These findings are nonspecific. They can be seen in toxic or 
metabolic encephalopathy or a bihemispheric process. There is some asymmetry to the bursts 
of rhythmic delta activity which may be correlated with the MRI imaging. In this patient with a 
single focal seizure there are no definitive sharp waves.
