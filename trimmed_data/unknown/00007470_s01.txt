MEDICATIONS: Antihypertensives, Dilantin, Trazodone, and Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  There is artifact picked up at the C4 electrode throughout much of the record.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the record includes drowsiness or sleep.  In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage and somewhat disorganized with a small amount of background theta.  There is C4 artifact picked up throughout much of the record, but there also appears to be intermittent, superimposed right temporal focal slowing with occasional theta and delta, low amplitude.  Features of stage II sleep include vigorous, symmetric vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving at intermediate flash frequencies. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild degree of background disorganization in wakefulness. 
Intermittent focal slowing from the right temporal region.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the head rocking artifact picked up at C4, a follow-up study in the lab would be helpful to further delineate the focal slowing, which is in the adjacent region.
