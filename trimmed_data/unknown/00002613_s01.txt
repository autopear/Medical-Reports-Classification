MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Codeine, Acetaminophen 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation is completed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with a 6 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There are minor shifting asymmetries. The patient does not appear to have had a recent craniotomy and the EEG supports this observation in that there is no evidence of a breech rhythm. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild bilateral background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Of note, the relatively large subdural hematoma on the right may have attenuated activity but this did not seem to be a prominent feature.
