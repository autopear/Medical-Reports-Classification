MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an 11.5 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient appears to be tense with a great deal of muscle artifact. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with vertex waves in stage I sleep and multiple, spontaneous arousals in stage I sleep.  The patient starts to fall asleep early on in the record, as soon as hyperventilation is discontinued.  Features of stage II sleep include spindles.  
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces an increase in the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits LAMBDA and brief bilateral driving.  The patient is falling asleep in photic stimulation. 
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This patient appears to be excessively drowsy, falling asleep during the stimulation phases.  This may be due to sleep deprivation or the use of sedative hypnotic medications for pain.
