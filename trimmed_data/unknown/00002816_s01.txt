INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation were performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG in the awake state is well-organized. The 
background consists of alpha but is less vigorous. Photic stimulation was performed, 
and it produced supraharmonic driving. Hyperventilation was performed, also. There 
was no seizure activity, no focal or epileptiform features. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity or focal features were found. 
Absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Additional 
EEG may be useful to capture any epileptiform activity. May want to consider outpatient 
DigiT race.
