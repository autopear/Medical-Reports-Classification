MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a low amplitude, well modulated, 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During sleep vertex waves, sleep spindles, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), and K-complexes are captured.   
Hyperventilation produces a mild slowing in the background.   
Photic stimulation produces no change in the background.
FINDINGS:  
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 22 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
