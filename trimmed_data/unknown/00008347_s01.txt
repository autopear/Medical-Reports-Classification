INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.  Photic stimulation is completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm in a relatively high amplitude record. There are bursts of hypersynchronous  rhythmic slowing and a small amount of shifting slowing some of which is sharply contoured particularly in the right mid temporal regions. There is also some notched bifrontal delta and clear wicket observed on the left. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
	HR: 	84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Occasional shifting slowing.
2.  Left temporal delta and disruption of theta
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG. The features described above are nonspecific and could be seen in the context of medical illness, postictal state or many other causes. Given the sharply contoured nature of this EEG, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
