MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG includes excessive theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing with vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. 
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and sleep due to:  
Excessively slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
