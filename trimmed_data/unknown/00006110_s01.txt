MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lopressor, ___________, and Dilaudid.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was agitated during the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.  Most of the EEG requires review with a 35 Hz filter.  The overall background is slow and disorganized.  There is a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm at 6 Hz, 40 uV, however, the patient isnâ€™t particularly cooperative.  In the portions of the record that are interpretable, there may be some triphasic waves.  In this background of rhythmic theta and irregular delta, there are some portions where there is a suggestion of a bit of slowing on the right.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Technically limited EEG in wakefulness through brief stage I sleep, which included vertex waves, but abnormal due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing with arrhythmic theta and irregular delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is technically adequate to determine that there is an EEG signature for an encephalopathy.  It is not adequate to assess for epileptiform activity such as sharp waves or spikes. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing with sedation may be required.
