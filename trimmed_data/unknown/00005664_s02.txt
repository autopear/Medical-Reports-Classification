MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, steroids, Morphine, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is somnolent during the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow, low voltage, and relatively symmetric.  A breach rhythm is seen in the left central area with arrhythmic delta activity with an increase in the amplitude.  Occasionally, FIRDA activity is seen. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow background.
Breach rhythm.
Occasional FIRDA.
Focal slow left central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In comparison to this patientâ€™s previous EEG of January 19, 2004, this tracing is somewhat improved.
