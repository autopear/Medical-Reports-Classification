MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.   
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage I sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and fairly well organized.  There is an 8.5 Hz, 75 to 100 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.   During hyperventilation, occasional bursts of slow theta and delta activity are seen in the left temporal or right temporal area. This burst pattern is also seen in drowsiness.  Drowsiness is characterized by vertex waves. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  
Photic stimulation elicits driving. 
HR:  56 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Irregular bursts of slow theta and delta activity in the left or right temporal area. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The above finding is a non-specific pattern and may be linked to the underlying pathologic process secondary to the frontal lobe contusion.  However, no epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or sleep deprivation prior to the EEG may be helpful.
