INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The patient seems to be a bit more awaken in the initial portions of the record with an alpha  rhythm discernable on the left, but a clear intrahemispheric asymmetry.  There is major theta rhythm on the left, the activity on the right is slower with more arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity. There is a right posterior temporal sharp wave observed in the background. Sometimes it demonstrates a more mid temporal localization with a biphasic component.  The epileptiform activity, when present, is high amplitude and complex in morphology. As the recording continues the background EEG is a bit more arrhythmic and the sharp waves have a simpler morphology.
	HR:	70 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	A  background that seems to be increasingly slow over the course of the record.
	2.	lntrahemispheric asymmetry with arrhythmic delta, more prominent on the right.
	3. 	Epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere, primarily in the temporal regions with favorable maximum.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports structural functional abnormality on the right with a localization to epileptiform activity on the right. Of  concern, the background is slower at the close of the record.  Careful clinical correlation is advised if this patient was not being sedated or if there was no other explanation for the increasing somnolence and slowing in the background.
