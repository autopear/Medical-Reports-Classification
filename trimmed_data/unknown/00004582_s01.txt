MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, and insulin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 Hz, 30 to 50 uV and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The EEG demonstrates mild excess background theta and occasional, shifting right greater than left temporal subtle theta with occasional delta.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Excess background theta. 
Occasional, shifting irregular temporal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These features are non-specific and contributing factors can include the history of head trauma, as well as postictal state.  If further characterization of his epilepsy is important, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is recommended.
