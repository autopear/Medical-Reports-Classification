INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 6.5 to 7 hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, front to central beta activity. The overall pattern is well-organized albeit a bit slow.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Lambda is observed in wakefulness. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving response.
	HR:	66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.    A well organized but slow alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are seen. The findings described above are nonspecific and could be due to his dementia or his medications.  In contrast to previous studies, no epileptiform features were observed today.
