MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, morphine, Phenytoin, Zyprexa, Keppra, and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is perf01med at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20  system  of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION   OF   THE    
RECORD:   The   background   EEG   demonstrates   an
intrahemispheric asymmetry.  In maximal wakefulness, the background from the left is mildly  slow.   The  right  hemisphere  demonstrates intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm with right posterior quadrant delta.  As the patient reaches sleep, there are vertex waves and beta activity, but the beta is asymmetric, a bit more on the left than the right with some lower voltage delta from the right hemisphere including centrotemporal and occipitotemporal regions.
HR: 90BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
l. Focal  slowing from the right posterior quadrant in fact the right hemisphere, with disruption of faster frequency activity and delta in the posterior quadrant.
2.  Mild slowing from the left.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar  to a previous EEG. 	No epileptiform features were identified in this record.
