MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Serax, and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for a generous amount of background beta and a small amount of background theta.  There is a 10 Hz, symmetric and reactive alpha rhythm.  There is a fair amount of movement artifact.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the history described above, this EEG is remarkable for the absence of focal or epileptiform activity. If additional information is needed, a repeat tracing when the patient is more cooperative may be useful.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
