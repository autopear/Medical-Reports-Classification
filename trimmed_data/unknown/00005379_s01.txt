MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/beside? using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed, but hyperventilation was not due to the patient’s asthma.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 15 to 20 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving at 5 Hz and faster flash frequencies.
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. If further characterization of this patient’s epileptic focus is needed, a repeat study could be helpful.
