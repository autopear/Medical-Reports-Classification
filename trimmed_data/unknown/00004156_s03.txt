MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Midazolam, Labetalol, Ceftazidime 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and 
comatose. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG includes diffuse, slow delta. 
There is higher amplitude delta in the left frontal region in this markedly slow record. 
There is a bit faster frontal frequency in the parasagittal regions. Stimulation of the 
patient also produced some theta in this region as well. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slow delta with a slow featureless background. 
2. Asymmetry with a bit of a faster frequency on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral 
function. The left hemisphere may be less impacted than the right. No epileptiform 
features were seen.
