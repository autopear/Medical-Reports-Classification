DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The right 
hemisphere is a little disorganized, but there is an alpha rhythm of 9-10 hertz and a small · 
amount of background theta. In contrast, the left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta, 
disruption of faster frequency activity, and a left anterior temporal spike and &low wave complex · 
maximum at T1 with a generous field of spread Including F7 and also T3. As the recording 
continues, the epileptiform activity. diminishes and an alpha rhythm starts to emerge out of the 
left. Relatively persistent arrhythmic delta Is observed from the left hemisphere, particularly in 
the temporal regions. Features of drowsiness are observed at the close of the record with an 
increase in bilateral background slowing. 
HR: 60bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Left anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave 
2. Arrhythmic delta activity from the !eft hemisphere maximum in the anterior temporal 
regions. congruent with the spikes and notched epileptiform activity. 
3. Background slowing, particularly on the right, with some improvement over time. 
4. Intrahemisphetic asymmetry. 
on the left as well as a 
localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
