MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is described as poorly responsive and intubated, but behaviorally she is more awake with spontaneous eye movements.  The EEG shows primarily a pattern of diffuse 5 to 7 Hz theta activity with a suggestion of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and occasional shifting arrhythmic delta.  With stimulation, she opens her eyes on one occasion, but never interacts with the technologist, although she does move spontaneously and does open and close her eyes spontaneously.  Occasional chewing movements are noted. 
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Occasional shifting arrhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is markedly improved compared to a previous pattern, which was nearly discontinuous.  The degree of background slowing is not as prominent as one might expect given the patientâ€™s poor mental status.  In the context of a patient who is recovering from a severe, underlying encephalopathy, this may be influenced by her chronic CNS condition.
