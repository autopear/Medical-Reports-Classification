MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Toprol, antiarrhythmics, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The technologist notes that she has a great deal of difficulty obtaining impedances under 10 because of scalp oil.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In wakefulness and in hyperventilation, there are rare, brief bursts of 3 to 5 Hz activity from the left temporal region, all less than one second in duration.  Hyperventilation does not otherwise augment the record.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. 
Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. 
HR:  54 BPM, with rare PVCs.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Rare left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The focal slowing is of unclear clinical significance in a subject of this age and may be due to this patientâ€™s previous stroke.  Previous EEGs were normal.
