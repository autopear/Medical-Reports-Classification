MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Labetalol, Heparin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake and drowsy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low-to-medium amplitude, continuous with a mixture of theta and alpha frequency activity.  There is a discernable posterior dominant rhythm. There is an asymmetry noted from the right frontocentral regions with disruption of faster frequency activity in this region and a bit more rhythmic right frontotemporal theta and delta.  This can be identified in drowsiness and in wakefulness. 
HR:  84 BPM with occasional ectopy. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing from the left.
Intermittent slowing from the right with disruption of faster frequency activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG supports both a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and a more significant structural abnormality on the right than the left.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
