MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Topiramate, and many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of background theta activity.  The major abnormalities in this record include intermittent focal slowing with arrhythmic or rhythmic delta/theta from the left anterior temporal region, as well as intermittent left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave and spike and slow wave complexes.   This may reach amplitudes of 75 V.  There are rare, FP2 sharp waves identified in this record. 
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity and focal slowing.
Rare right frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous records, this record differs dramatically in that left anterior temporal sharp and slow waves and focal slowing were seen.  In this patient’s many EEGs, only in the 1996 study was there ever a single left anterior temporal sharp wave.  Consideration for a new process to explain this patient’s worsening epilepsy is appropriate.  These results were communicated to the attending physician.
