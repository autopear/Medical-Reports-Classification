MEDICATIONS: Lamictal and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric, low voltage.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not identified.  There is low voltage, diffuse beta activity and occasional left temporal focal slowing with left temporal sharp waves. Rare right temporal sharp or spike activity is seen. Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR:  84 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized background with an absent alpha rhythm.
Left temporal focal slowing with sharp and spike activity 
Rare right temporal sharp and spike activity.
Diffusely excessive beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features seen in this tracing may be suggestive of a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.
