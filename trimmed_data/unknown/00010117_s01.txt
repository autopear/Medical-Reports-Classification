MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside on the floor using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hypoventilation 
and photic stimulation was not performed. This is a sleep stage two record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the wakefulness the background EEG is 
symmetric continuous, but superimposed with excessive slow activity in the theta range. 
There is posterior dominant slow alpha rhythm at 7 Hz, which is attenuated with eyes 
opened. The patient is easily falling asleep. With the tracing continuing on, vertex 
waves, spindles, and complexes were seen. 
Stimulation of the patient produced wakefulness by increased muscle artifact, as well as 
increased fast activity and decreased amplitude of slow wave form in the background. 
However, no abnormal findings were seen. 
Heart rate 66 BPM. 
Abnormal EEG in sleepiness due to: 
1. Background slow activity in the theta range. 
2. Slow alpha activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG tracing is with nonspecific findings and can be 
seen in cephalopathy due to metabolic toxic drug intoxication postictal phase, dementia, 
and others. Clinical correlation is recommended. However, no focal findings, no 
epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing. If seizure is a clinical concern, repeat 
EEG may be helpful.
