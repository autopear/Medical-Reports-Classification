MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Decadron, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.    This  is  an  awake  and  asleep  record.  The  patient  had  a  recent  neurosurgical evaluation.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In   maximal   wakefulness,   the   background   EEG demonstrates, at best, a slow pattern with excess background theta and  a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 8  Hz.   In wakefulness,  there are occasional bursts of generalized background slowing, and there are a handful of bursts that are more remarkable from the right than the left. At other times, particularly later in the record, around the time of photic stimulation, there is a bit more left-sided slowing  and there are rare left frontocentral sharp waves noted in the record, which can be distinguished from the patient's  EKG artifact.   Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record, but does elicit some photoelectric artifact.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of background slowing.
HR.:  104BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Generalized background slowing with excess theta.
Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal delta.
	3. 	Occasional focal slowing seen particularly at the close of the record, sometimes with two different localizations: sometimes on the right, but later in the record, in the left frontocentral region with rare sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This  EEG supports  a diffuse disturbance  of cerebral  function. Given the clinical history, fewer than expected localizing features were noted.
