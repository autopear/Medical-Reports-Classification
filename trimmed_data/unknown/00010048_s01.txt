MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 to 8 Hz, 40 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background and a small degree of background slowing. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR:  88 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
	1.	Mild background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and support a mild, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Contributing factors may include the patientâ€™s underlying neurologic or psychiatric disorder or medication effect.
