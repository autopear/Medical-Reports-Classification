INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is extremely agitated in the initial portions 
of the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording begins the patient is agitation the 
background EEG demonstrates a pattern with fast of frequency activity, and muscle artifact As 
the patient stopped shaking, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry observed with a high 
amplitude spike in slow wave or sharp and slow wave complex from the left hemisphere with a 
generous field of spread including T1 at 7 and T3. At time, this is a multiphasic or polyphasic 
spike. The spike is not associated with the patient's spells of shaking and rocking his head back 
and forth. Other behaviors observed by this patient include oral automatism and agitation, 
however, these seem to occur in the portions of the record with less in the way of spiking. Most 
of the spiking is variable, sometimes quite infrequent, but sometimes appearing with couplets, 
but without prolonged bursts. 
HR: 120 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Abnormal background. 
2. High amplitude almost periodic sharp waves from the left hemisphere. 
3. Associated focal slowing on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports and irritative process on the left. Given the 
prominence of the epileptiform activity. Additional EEG recording when the patient is able to 
tolerate such is advised.
