INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. No photic stimulation, 
hyperventilation performed. The patient intubated and with wrist restraints. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness this EEG shows disorganized, 
asymmetric background with slower theta delta pattern on right, that becomes slightly 
more symmetric as the record continues but the theta delta pattern continues on the 
right During the record, the patient is seen actively moving his left side, but not 
correlating change of the EEG pattern is seen 
HR: 90 bpm with occasional ectopic beats. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slowness of background, right hemisphere greater then left .. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen in this record. 
Slower background on the right may be consistent with a structural abnormality.
