MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol Dilantin,
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness background EEG is acceptably organized for age with 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and central mu rhythm. Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta, however, and the early drowsy record is a bit more disorganized that 1 might anticipate. Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
	HR: 	78  bpm
IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background disorganization in early drowsiness
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed.
