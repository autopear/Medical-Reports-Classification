MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, insulin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient who is drowsy throughout much of the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In brief, maximum wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz and a posterior dominant rhythm of 25 V.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is intermittent drop-out of faster frequency activity on the right and some slow rolling eye movements.  In addition, there is superimposed focal delta from the right hemisphere in drowsiness. There are also some bursts of generalized delta in an otherwise early drowsy pattern.
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent focal slowing in drowsiness from the right hemisphere.
Intermittent delta early in drowsiness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing carries an intermittent correlation with an underlying structural abnormality on the right.   The patient appears to be quite somnolent. This may be due to medications, postictal state, or toxic or metabolic factors.  In this state, there are intermittent bursts of delta which are prominent in early drowsiness.
