MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Famotidine, Lovenox, Cefepime, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and wearing a collar.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient seems to be awake with spontaneous eye movement.  The overall pattern is relatively symmetric and includes 6 Hz theta and frontocentral beta.  Stimulation of the patient produces artifact and then an increase in beta.  There is a small degree of variability noted in the record.  
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Primarily arrhythmic theta pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
