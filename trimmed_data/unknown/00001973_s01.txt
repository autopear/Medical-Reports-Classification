MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, Singular, Dilantin 
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation are completed. 
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant 
rhythm of 40-50 microvolts. There is generous beta noted in drowsiness. 
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude 
of the background, as well as some hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Spindles are 
noted in stage 2 sleep. The patient transitions readily into between wakefulness and 
sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and does not activate 
the record. 
HR: 55 bpm and slightly irregular in hyperventilation. 
EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep. 
CLINICAL There were no focal nor epileptiform features identified in 
this record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Additional 
recording capturing one of the patient's spells may be of value.
