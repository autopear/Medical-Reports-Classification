MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system 
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is unable to sit still. She 
actually gets up in the gurney and lays her hand on the left side of the railing during the 
EEG. 
OF THE RECORD: Although it is a challenging EEG, it is diffusely slow 
with beta frequency activity. There is an interhemispheric asymmetry with a bit slower 
activity on the right compared to the left. In this somewhat sharply contoured back 
ground, there is a suggestion of a left mid to posterior temporal sharp wave. Photic 
stimulation is performed at the close of the record when the patient is somewhat more
cooperative or at least moving around less and does not activate the record. 
HR: 70 bpm, irregular 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EGG due to: 
1. Background slowing. 
2. Interhemispheric asymmetry. 
3. Suggestion of a sharp wave on the left in contrast to the slower frequency on the 
right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Due to the poor cooperation to more completely assess 
the patient, a follow-up study should be performed.
