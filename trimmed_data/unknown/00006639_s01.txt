MEDICATIONS: Ancef, Dilantin, Tylenol, Zofran, Morphine, Tylenol #3. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There are patient 
events recorded including time 21:38 and the recording concludes at 1 p.m. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Through much of the record, there is a 10Hz 
posterior dominant rhythm observed. There is a small amount of intermittent temporal 
theta seen in wakefulness. The sleep record includes vertex waves, K complexes and 
spindles. Sleep record is symmetric. Practice push buttons are observed at 21:38. 
There is a push button at 05:37. The nurse is interacting with the patient. The patient is 
in the dark. No epileptiform features are seen prior to the placement of the push button 
and afterwards there is significant muscle artifact. The seizure detector is reviewed. No 
clinical seizures are observed with the spike detections. The spike detections primarily 
identify sleep, including features of stage II and transition to slow wave sleep. The spike 
detection at 06:40 demonstrates arousal. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for: 
1. Scant theta observed only in the early portion of the record 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No electrographic seizures, no lnterictal spikes and no 
clinical seizures recorded in this overnight long term monitor recording.
