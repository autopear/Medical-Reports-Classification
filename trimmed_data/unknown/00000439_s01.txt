MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Solu-Medrol, Protonix, Insulin 
Digital video EEG was performed in bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is examined 
extensively during the EEG. Muscle artifact is observed. 
OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly low voltage and 
suppressed. There is also some muscle twitch artifact observed. Stimulation of the 
patient does not activate the record. The record can be reviewed at low sensitivities 
again with a very featureless appearing record. Using other techniques including an 
average background sensitivity of 2, again there is artifact. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Markedly suppressed background. 
CLINICAL There is a fair amount of muscle artifact. If appropriate, 
repeat study with a neuromuscular blocker may be considered. It is possible that there 
is no cerebral activity and that what one is observing is entirely artifact, but the 
technologist does not allow it to be definitive or certain.
