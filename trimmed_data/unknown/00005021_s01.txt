MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lamictal. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low-voltage 10.5 Hz 
alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage fronto-central beta activity. The 
technologist struggles with this patient because of prominent sweat artifact on this 
unusually warm day. Hyperventilation produces an Increase in amplitude. Drowsiness 
is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a low-voltage driving 
response. 
HR: 72bpm 
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed in this record. A 
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is 
necessary, a repeat study with more extensive sleep is suggested.
