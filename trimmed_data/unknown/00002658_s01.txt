MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, and Atenolol.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is sedated and asleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. Instead, pencil and verbal stimulation were performed.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is in light sleep. The background EEG is symmetric and continuous with superimposed excessive slow theta and delta activity.  There is a 7 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm. Pencil or verbal stimuli transiently increased the posterior alpha rhythm, as well as muscle movement artifact.  
HR:  108 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Mildly disorganized background with excessive theta and delta activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG pattern is suggestive of a dysfunction of gray matter or suppressed cortex neurons due to either a postictal phase or pharmacologic sedation.  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A repeat EEG when the patient is more alert or when tapered off sedatives with routine activation parameters such as sleeping and hyperventilation may provide additional information.
