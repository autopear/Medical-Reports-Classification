MEDICATIONS: Tylenol, morphine and Dilantin. FILE 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. This is an awake through sleeping stage II
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: At the opening of the record, the background of the EEG was symmetric and fairly well organized. There is a 9Hz 20 microvolt posterior dominant alpha rhythm which is well attenuated with eyes open. This is small amplitude and beta activity frontally. With tracing continuing on, the patient was falling asleep and with increased slow activity spindles and vertex waves as well as notch amplitude and slow delta activity throughout the tracing but less than 50% of the epoch. However, focal finding, no epileptiform discharge was seen in this tracing. 
Heart rate 102 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and sleeping stage II. 
No focal findings, no epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing. Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is a strong clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
