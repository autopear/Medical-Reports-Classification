MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, morphine, and Atenolol. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and low voltage.  There is a 10 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Lambda waves are seen.  In drowsiness, POSTS are seen.  Sleep is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, a mixed frequency pattern  with theta followed by vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.  Photic stimulation elicits driving. 
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal linits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
