INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there are sections of the record which are well organized with 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Prominent lambda activity is observed. In the transition to sleep, there is rhythmic theta and there are occasional bursts of rhythmic theta in the background earlier than one would except. Abundant stage 2 sleep includes vertex, K complexes, spindles and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
	HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Intermittent rhythmic theta.
	2. 	Intermittent background slowing.
	3. 	Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, this is the best organized study to date for this patient. This is a 3rd EEG without epileptiform activity , surprising in that it is a postictal study. September 07, 2009.
