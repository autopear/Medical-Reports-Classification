MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and other psychiatric medications. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This patient appears to be very drowsy.  In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha with rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles in stage II sleep.  
The patient starts to fall asleep in photic and sleep patterns are achieved.  Hyperventilation produces no specific activating responses, although the patient is again falling asleep.
HR:  88 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The hypersomnolence may be due to sleep deprivation or even this patientâ€™s medications.  This is a second, normal EEG for this young woman.  Either correlation with her childhood EEGs or a more prolonged recording would be helpful to characterize her seizure disorder.
