MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Morphine, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The study begins when the 
patient is somnolent. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the patient is somewhat 
drowsy, but she has relatively frequent eye opening, attempts to keep her awake. 
Background includes some theta frequency activity and a glimpse of a 7-8 Hz posterior 
dominant rhythm. In wakefulness there is a high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp 
complex which can be clearly differentiated from the patient's EKG artifact. It also 
disrupts the background. Features of drowsiness includes an increase in rhythmic 
slowing. The anterior temporal sharp wave persists into sleep. They are not, however, 
accentuated by sleep. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. High amplitude left temporal sharp wave. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for 
epilepsy.
