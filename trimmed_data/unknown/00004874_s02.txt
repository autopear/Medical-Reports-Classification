MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Insulin, Lorazepam, Heparin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake, restless 
with frequent oral automatisms. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is diffusely slow, poorly 
organized and lacks the normal morphology of an adult EEG. When the patient drifts off 
to sleep, there is some vertex waves. There are also some periodic sharp complexes 
identified in the left temporal region with a generous field of spread, left central, left 
frontotemporal. These are not discernible when the patient has muscular movement 
artifact. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing and poor organization. 
2. Rare periodic sharp waves identified from the left temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is markedly improved compared to previous 
studies. The epileptiform activity described above was seen almost continuously in the 
first EEG.
