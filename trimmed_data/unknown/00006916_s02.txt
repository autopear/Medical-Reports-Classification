		
This is a long term monitor so dates of study range from October
22, 2008 through October 23, 2008.
	MEDICATIONS: 	16 mg of Ativan, Dilantin load, propofol drip, midazolam drip and Topamax.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10120 system of electrode placement with 1
	channel of EKG.  This is a long term monitor is broken up into 5 sessions due to emergent CAT scans.
		DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Throughout most of the record there is
	is attenuation of the right side which is maybe due to
		cranioplasty. 	Throughout the record there is epileptiform activity suggesting that the patient is in status which at some point is accompanied by eye twitching. 	In addition there are some sections of the record that are discontinuous that are actually followed by suppression with flattening for 15 seconds. Heart rate 90 beats per minute.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Attenuation of the right side.
2. Epileptiform activity indicative of status epilepticus
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient's right side attenuation is compatible with the recent cranioplasty.  The continued status epilepticus on current medications is concerning and would
titrate medications appropriately to control both clinical seizures as well as EEG findings.
