MEDICATIONS: Fluoxetine, antiametics, amitriptyline, Percocet, Dilantin, and Decadron.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 40 to 80 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The posterior dominant rhythm is higher amplitude on the left than the right.  In addition, there is occasional focal slowing identified from the right hemisphere, particularly the central and the occipital scalp regions.  This is somewhat accentuated in hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include initially an increase in delta, again from the right central and occipital regions early in drowsiness.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Slower frequency photic stimulation elicits an irregular, spiky occipital response with underlying focal slowing more prominent from the right posterior quadrant.  Faster frequency does not elicit the same irregularities, just some rhythmic slowing.  
HR:  76 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere, particularly the central and occipital regions.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The irregular photic response is of unclear clinical significance.  Given the sharpness of the background, no clear epileptiform activity can be identified with a photic response.  This tracing supports a structural abnormality on the right.
