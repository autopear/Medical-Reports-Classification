INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
Background EEG demonstrated burst suppression pattern which is relatively 
homogeneous. There is relatively rhythmic medium amplitude and primary theta 
frequency activity occurring in brief bursts with periods of suppression of typically 3 
seconds in duration. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record. As the 
recording continues, the suppressions increase in duration heading towards 5 seconds.
