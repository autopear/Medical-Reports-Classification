INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized. In addition, there is slowing on the right with an alpha rhythm of 7.5 to 8 Hz. The left hemisphere demonstrates intermittent to continuous arrhythmic delta activity, particularly in the initial portions of the record with left anterior temporal sharp waves mixed in these bursts of rhythmic and semirhythmic focal slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Continuous rhythmic slowing from the left temporal region. 
2. Left temporal sharp waves. 
3. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports an irritative focus on the left. No clinical seizures were recorded.
