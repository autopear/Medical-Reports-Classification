MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, antifungal medications, Dilantin, Ativan, Fentanyl, dopamine, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is very low voltage, but continuous and includes a pattern of very low voltage theta and smaller amounts of intermittent beta and delta.  No reactivity can be identified in this low voltage pattern. 
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, mixed frequency, diffuse slow pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patientâ€™s critical illness as well as his medications may play a role in the pattern described above. No epileptiform features were identified in this record.
