MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.   The patient is awake  throughout the majority  of the  EEG.   He is not, however, particularly interactive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern.  There is high amplitude periodic sharp waves, bursts of sharply contoured theta, and evolving sharp and slow wave activity from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal region, but with a generous field of spread and with some variability including T3. On two occasions, following a burst of evolving sharp activity and mixed theta and delta, the patient is stimulated by the  technologist.    Stimulation attenuates  the  epileptiform  activity  and  produces  more  of  an alerting, theta pattern.  The activity from the right hemisphere in relaxed wakefulness is one of a mixture of theta and delta.
HR:   110 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Periodic sharp waves and sharply contoured delta and theta from the left temporal region.
2.   Subclinical seizures without a definite behavioral correlate. The activity does seem to evolve.
3.   A stimulus responsiveness to this epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the examiners may not have realized that, on both occasions,  stimulation  of  the  patient  produced  an  alerting  response  and  despite  muscle  and movement artifact elimination of the epileptiform activity.   These fmdings may be part of a profoundly epileptogenic pattern.  It may be part of an interictal pattern or part of a subclinical seizure-like pattern.  Ongoing monitoring is warranted.
