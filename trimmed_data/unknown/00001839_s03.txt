INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG performed at bedside using standard
10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This was a 24 hour study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  A right polyspike wave in the occipital rigion is seen. continuation of the right poly spike wave in the occipital region are seen. Sometimes there are some spreading to the left hemisphere. Periods of attenuation are seen lasting one to two seconds in duration between and bilateral. As the discharges continue there was a loss of video until the next morning. During this time, there is continued poly spoke waves seen in the right hemisphere.   Again, there is no evolution of this activity. There is loss of the T2 electrode as the patient is seen moving in the video.  The electrode is fixed and continuation of the poly spike and attenuation is seen. There is some improvement in the occipital right poly spike activity with mainly more attenuated background.
	HR:	102 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG.  Please refer to the final report to get the full impression and clinical correlation.
