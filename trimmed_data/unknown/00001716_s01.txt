MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, and Topiramate. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. For this challenging individual with bruxism, hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG shows a variable pattern.  There are some portions which show moderate disorganization for an awake adult with a 7 to 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and overall a theta frequency pattern.  This pattern is frequently interrupted by rhythmic bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant notched either rhythmic theta or delta, as well as spike and slow wave activity ranging from 2 Hz to 4 Hz, more commonly in the range of 4 Hz than slower than this.  The patient has intermittent bruxism, chewing movements, and movements of the hands and the face.  Sleep was not achieved.  
HR:  110 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Challenging EEG, but abnormal due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Frontally predominant, rhythmic 2.5 to 4 Hz spike and wave activity.
Rhythmic bursts of high amplitude frontal theta and delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the technical issues, this EEG may under-represent the breadth of this patientâ€™s epileptiform activity.  The activity appears to be grossly symmetric, but subtle asymmetries could be missed given the amount of motor activity.
