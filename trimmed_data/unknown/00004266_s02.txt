MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. No photic stimulation or hyperventilation performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness this is a disorganized record with background full alpha reaching 7 Hz. In the background  there is irregular right temporal delta seen anteriorly, greater on the right than the left. There is also right anterior temporal sharp waves and shifting arrhythmic delta seen throughout the record.
	HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Abnormal irregular delta seen in the right temporal region with a train of temporal sharps.
	2. 	Occasional left anterior sharps.
	3. 	Shifting slowing and mild background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This finding of slowing is consistent with structural abnormality on the right with a role of epilepsy in this patient. Occasional bihemispheric slowing could be consistent with a bilateral process.
