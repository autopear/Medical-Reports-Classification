MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized for a subject of this age with an 8.5 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is occasional rhythmic, lower voltage theta seen independently from either hemisphere, left or right.  Photic stimulation elicits minimal bilateral driving response.  
Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing with occasional bursts of slowing in the right posterior quadrant.   
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Intermittent slowing identified from either hemisphere with more arrhythmic delta from the right and more rhythmic theta from the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this record. It may be helpful to correlate this EEG with this patientâ€™s imaging given his age.
