MEDICATIONS: Tetanus shot, Dilantin, Tylenol, and Thiamine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG  is performed in  the  lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background EEG is organized. The posterior rhythm is about 10Hz alpha, and the anterior rhythm is low voltage beta. Diffusely, there is excessive beta activity seen in this record.  Drowsiness and sleep were not noted during this record. There is no abnom1al epileptiform activity seen in this record.   There is no abnormal interhemispheric  attenuation or slowing seen in this record.
HR:  80BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG, however, there is excessive sedative  drug effect due  to beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this patient who is on sedative agents, the excess beta probably represents medication effect. However, abnormal epileptifom1 activity was not seen this record.
