MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, Tegretol, Phenobarbital, and others.  
INTRODUCTION: Seven-hour continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has one behavioral event while she is observed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with generous beta activity and a small amount of theta.  There is no epileptiform activity seen. Over the course of the record, despite some compromise of the electrodes, the background slowing seems to be reduced.  
EVENT: Time 9:20 AM.  The patient is awake and eating breakfast.  She stops eating and stares blankly into space, doesnâ€™t respond to the nurse or EEG technician, and then trembles.  This is followed by movement in the bed.  The patient throws her head back into the pillow.  This progresses and she starts to throw herself forwards and backwards, forwards and backwards into the bed, bouncing up and down a small amount.  The event is over at 9:23.  No epileptiform features are associated with this event and as soon as the patient stops moving, the EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern.   
HR:  100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This continuous bedside EEG monitoring is remarkable for: 
Excess background theta and beta.
One behavioral event without EEG change. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing and beta may be due to the medications that this patient received.  No epileptiform features were seen in this record.  These results were reviewed with the clinical team.
