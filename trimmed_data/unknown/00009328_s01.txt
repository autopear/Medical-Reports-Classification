MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG includes a 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm. A breech rhythm is appreciated in the left central area with focal slowing and beta accentuation.  Sharp waves are appreciated in the C3 region  with focal delta and theta slowing, as well as in the T3 and T7 regions in drowsiness and sleep.  The patient is drowsy throughout most of the record and in stage 1 sleep vertex waves are appreciated.  On photic stimulation there was a minimal driving response.
	HR:	66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	C3 and T3-T7 sharp waves with focal slowing at C3
	2. 	Breech rhythm in the left central region with beta accentuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The sharp waves and slowing that are appreciated in this recording are reflective of the patient's previous brain tumor resection and are
supportive of localization for a mechanism of his seizures.
