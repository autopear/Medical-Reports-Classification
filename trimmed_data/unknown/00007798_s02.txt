MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is unconscious during the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is continuous and disorganized with excessive theta activity.  There is an increased frequency and a little bit of increased amplitude of discharges at the F4, C4 region suggestive of a breach rhythm.    The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not identified.  Instead, 6 Hz activity is seen throughout the record.  As the tracing continues, frequent spike and sharp waves are seen at F8, C4, T4, and F4, sometimes occurring in trains lasting one to ten seconds. The interval between the spike and wave shortened and evolved into a long convulsive seizure or electrical seizure activity, which starts from P4 and C4, involving the entire right hemisphere, lasting for two minutes.  This same activity is seen twice during the recording without clinical seizures being correlated on the video camera.
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Disorganized background with excessive slowing.
	Absent alpha rhythm.
	Right frontal and central spike and waves.
	Two episodes of electric epileptiform discharges involving the entire right hemisphere lasting for two minutes. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is indicative of a severe cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter and is consistent with a history of a right subdural hematoma, as well as the craniotomy.  Breach activity is consistent with the skull defect after the brain procedure.  Long-term EEG monitoring for aggressive treatment for the non-epileptic discharges is recommended.  This was conveyed to the primary team.
