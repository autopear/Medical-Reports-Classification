MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and potassium. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasional temporal wicket is seen.  Coughing is associated with a 5 Hz artifact seen on the left.  Hyperventilation produces a coughing spell, as well as an increase in the amplitude of the background.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, wicket activity can be seen from the temporal regions bilaterally.  Other features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and rhythmic central theta. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. 
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  Immediately following hyperventilation, the patient has a very brief epoch of stage II sleep with K complexes. 
HR:  74 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief stage II sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In view of the unusual artifacts seen during hyperventilation in the ICU, a follow-up study in the lab is recommended.
