MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Isordil, and Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with clear eye opening and eye closure, but a relatively slow, featureless pattern with a mixture of delta and theta.  The tech observes the patient to have spontaneous eye opening, yawning, and biting on the endotracheal tube.  She feels that he is interactive with her.  The patient remains with the same state with eye opening and eye closure, but there is variability in the EEG and with the use of Cz montage, there is an increase in theta, as well as a small amount of beta seen in the background.   Stimulation of the patient, at the close of record, with clear tactile and auditory stimuli does not seem to activate the record.  
HR:  96 to 100 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Marked generalized slowing with prominent delta activity, but with only small amounts of theta and scant amounts of alpha or beta frequency activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant impact on the central nervous system.  Of note, the patient does have spontaneous arousals.  These findings must be placed in the context of overall detailed neurologic examination and imaging in terms of the impact of this patientâ€™s CNS insult.
