	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, Hydralazine, Coreg.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation is performed. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is
an awake and a sleep record
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	The waking pattern demonstrates a dynamic pattern. Portions of the record demonstrate a reasonably well organized background with posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5
Hertz. This is disrupted by intermittent bursts of rhythmic
frontal delta or bursts of mixed theta and delta. Some of this activity is somewhat irregular and asymmetric, more remarkable on the left than the right. There is also shifting arrhythmic delta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing generous bursts of relatively symmetric rhythmic frontal delta. As the patient becomes drowsy, the activity becomes more symmetric and rhythmic. The intermittent bursts of more sharply contra delta, however, remain discernible. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation has not elicited a driving response.
HR: 84 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent bursts of frontal.
2. Occasional shifting arrhythmic delta.
3. Occasional sharply contoured slowing from the left.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	The features described above can be seen in many different clinical scenarios, however, they are most
supportive of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. Because of
the shifting arrhythmic delta and some sharply contoured slowing on the left, consideration for a process on the left is suggested.
