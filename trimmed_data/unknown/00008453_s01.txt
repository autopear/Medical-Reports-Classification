MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-organized, 10 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.   Additional recording capturing deeper stages of sleep may be valuable to identify epileptiform activity.
