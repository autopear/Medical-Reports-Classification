	MEDICATIONS: 	Depakote, Dilantin, Versed, Propofol.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electro-placement  with 1 channel of EKG. The EEG demonstrates jerking of the patient including mouth and shoulders.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is cerebral activity identified bilaterally. There is sharply contoured paroxysmal approximately 3 Hz activity in the occipital regions, some of which seems to have an underlying sharper spike or fast component with it. This does not entirely correlate with the twitching, and the twitching is typically a very rapid myoclonic jerk with a different frequency. The occipitally predominant pattern is not clearly associated with a sustained motor phenomenon. In some sections of the record, the activity is clear. The epileptiform activity in the occipital regions is clearly maximum on the right. Some of the myoclonic jerking almost produces a clear EEG correlate that can be seen
by the camera, although it is seen by the tech, and at other
times the jerking can be witnessed, but overall the camera seems to underestimate the activity. Towards the close of the record, the myoclonic jerking seems to have abated, but the occipitally predominant slowing with this underlying fast discharge
persists.
HR: 140 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Occipitally predominant focus of epileptiform activity, right greater than left without clear clinical correlate.
3. Clinical myoclonus without clear EEG signature.
