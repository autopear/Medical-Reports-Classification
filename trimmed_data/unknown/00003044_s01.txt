INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background  EEG is markedly abnormal.  The left hemisphere is nearly normal with an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and generous beta activity.  The right hemisphere  demonstrates  a breach rhythm with significant arrhythmic delta activity and a high amplitude  fronto-central sharp wave with a generous field of spread involving C4, F4 and P4.  The camera is never on the patient's jerking of the hand but some of the sharp waves seem to correlate with the high amplitude sharp and slow wave complexes.  Overall, however, by report of examiner's present during the EEG, the epileptiform movements of the hand never stop even when the epileptiform activity does pause intermittently during the record. Bursts of activity may be between 2 and 15 seconds with cessation of the activity for no longer than 5 seconds.
	HR: 	90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Clinical syndrome of epilepsy partialis continua with continuous  focal motor activity of the left-handed arm but with intermittent and not continuous  high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes from the right front-central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG can be seen in the context of severe recalcitrant underlying epileptiform process.  Additional monitoring and intervention  may be appropriate. These results were reported to the clinical team on the date of the recording.
