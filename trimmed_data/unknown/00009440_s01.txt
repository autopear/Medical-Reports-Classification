MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Risperdal 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The tracing is done in the lab after referral from the 
emergency room. In wakefulness there is a 9-Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The 
patient is drowsy throughout much of the record. Hyperventilation is performed early on 
in the record and essentially produces a somewhat drowsy pattern. Photic stimulation 
elicits a bit of driving, but the patient is drifting off to stage I sleep with rhythmic theta 
and posts. 
HR: 66 bpm 
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for no epileptiform features. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If appropriate, a repeat study looking for epileptiform 
activity is indicated. This patient does appear to be excessively drowsy which could be 
due to a sleep phenomenon or post ictal state.
