MEDICATIONS: Xanax, Dilantin, Celexa, Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with a 10 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a modest amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits driving as well as a photoelectric effect. 
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep could be useful.
