MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote. 
INTR0DUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. No additional 
information is provided. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal. There is 
a prominent intra-hemispheric asymmetry with continuous arrhythmic delta activity from the left 
hemisphere with sharply contoured delta at T1/F7. The right hemisphere is slightly slow as well. 
The right hemisphere demonstrates some background slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm 
averaging 7 Hz, 30 microvolts. Occasional delta observed in that hemisphere as well. As the 
recording continues, the patient is a bit more alert and at the very close of the record there is 
increasing eye opening, eye closure and the alpha rhythm is improving in rhythmicity and it 
becomes present bilaterally. 
HR: 54 bpm 
IMPRESSION : Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. 
Initial very prominent arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere with sharply contoured 
delta, left temporal region. 
2. 
Background slowing improving bilaterally towards the close the record. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: For this patient who was admitted after a cluster of seizures on 
January 11, this EEG may represent a postictal pattern with improvement over time. The focal 
slowing, sharp waves and destruction of faster frequency activity, support a structural 
abnormality on the left involving gray and white matter as well as localization-related 
mechanism for epilepsy.
