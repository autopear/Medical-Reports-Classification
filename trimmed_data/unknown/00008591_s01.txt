MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, aspirin, Tylenol, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, an alpha rhythm of 8.5 to 10 Hz, 40 V is seen.  The patient also has prominent sindependent temporal theta/delta.  There is independent right and left temporal sharp waves.  Mu waves in the central region are seen bilaterally.  Sharp waves are seen in the right temporal area in the setting of breach.  Photic stimulation elicits driving at intermediate flash frequencies.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent right and left temporal slowing 
Independent left and right temporal sharp waves in the right temporal region in the setting of breach.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: The independent right and left temporal slowing and sharp waves supports a bilateral  temporal lobe problem.
