INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE R ECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Photic stimulation is performed early on in the first epoch provided. The second section of the EEG provided includes wakefulness and drowsiness.  In wakefulness again, there is a 10 to 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized
by slow rolling eye movements and increase in theta.  Hyperventilation does not
activate the record.  Notable, in the transition to stage 2 sleep, there is a little muscle artifact, but no epileptiform activity.
