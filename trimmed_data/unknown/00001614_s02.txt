MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Ativan, Dilantin, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-
20 system of electrode  placement with one channel of EKG. The  patient is lethargic and is agitated with arousal.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern, rich in beta frequency activity.  There is intermittent attenuation of the beta frequency activity, which is present bilaterally.   There is also an asymmetry with  at times more beta frequency activity on the left compared to the right, and a bit more slower arrhythmic delta from the right particularly in the posterior quadrant.  Of note, this EEG is recorded in an individual in a hard collar. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity and eliminates the intermittent attenuation in the background.
HR.: 90BPM.
IM   PRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generous background beta.
2.   An intermittently discontinuous pattern.
3.   Asymmetry with more arrhythmic delta on the right and less beta activity on the right.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. It has pharmacologic hallmarks of sedation for this individual.  The beta asymmetry and the delta asynm1etry support a structural process involving the right more than the left.  No epileptiform features were seen.
