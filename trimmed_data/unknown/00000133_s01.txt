MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video BEG is performed in the lab using standard  10-20 system  of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, the background  BEG is continuous  and slightly disorganized  with mild generalized  slowing due to excessive  theta.  There i s occasional left  anterior  temporal  slowing,  sometimes  with  anÂ·hythmic delta  activity  seen  best  at  F7. Occasional  left frontotemporal  sharp waves were seen in this location.  The shape of the sharp and spike waves suggests a breach  rhythm.   Stage IT sleep is achieved  and characterized  by K complexes  and spindles.   Excessive beta activity is also seen in the frontocentral  regions. Photic stimulation elicits  symmetric bilateral driving.
HR.: 87BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal BEG due to:
1.   Mild left anterior temporal slowing
	2. 	Occasional sharp waves.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: This tracing  supports a focal or localization-related mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  Conelation with neuroimaging studies is appropriate.
