MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal, poorly organized with at times a 9 Hz low voltage posterior dominant rhythm. The posterior dominant rhythm is sometimes disrupted on the left compared to the right.  Both hemispheres are abnormal with excess theta and disorganization, but the left hemisphere demonstrates a high amplitude left anteriotemporal spike and slow wave complex.   Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, accentuating the focal slowing from the left frontotemporal region more so than the right, as well as the epileptiform activity.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta activity.  In addition, other features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The epileptiform activity is quite prominent in wakefulness and does not clearly increase in sleep.  Other features of sleep include spread of the epileptiform activity to the left frontocentral region, as well as beta spindles that are asymmetric, present bilaterally, but higher amplitude on the left.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for photoelectric artifact.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly abnormal background.
High amplitude left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes with spread to the left frontocentral region in sleep.
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with epileptiform activity on the left, disruption of the alpha on the left, and higher amplitude beta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy and should be correlated with imaging.
