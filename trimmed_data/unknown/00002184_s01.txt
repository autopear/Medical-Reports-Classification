MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is appropriately organized with 9 Hz 50-microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Head rocking artificial and slow rolling eye movements are observed in drowsiness.  Hyperventilation is characterized  by additional head rocking activity.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
	HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite ongoing seizures, no epileptiform features were observed in this EEG.  If characterization  of this individuals epileptiform activity is important, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is advised.
