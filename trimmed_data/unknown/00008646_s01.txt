MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Codeine, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is perfom1ed at the bedside using standard  10-20 system  of electrode placement  with one channel  of EKG.  This is an awake  and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In  wakefulness,  there  is  an  8.5  Hz  poste1ior dominant   rhythm,  which  can  be  discerned  bilaterally.    The  overall  background   has  a mixture of theta with some arrhythmic delta identified from either hemisphere. There is a modest amount  of background  beta activity, and there is a suggestion of a breach rhythm from the left central  region  with an increase  in the amplitude  identified  intem1ittently  in that area.
HR:  66BPM.
IMPRESSION: Technically  somewhat  challenging EEG due to the amount  of muscle in the background, but abnom1al due to:
1.   Generalized  background  slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The  breach  rhythm  described  above  i s an  anticipated finding  following  craniotomy.  The background  and the bihem.isphe1ic features suggest  a diffuse rather than a localized  process.
