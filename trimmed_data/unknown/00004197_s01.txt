MEDICATION: Dilantin, many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel ofEKG.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness,  there  is  an  8.5  Hz,  posterior dominant  rhythm  with  a  small  amount  of  low  voltage,  frontocentral   beta  activity. Drowsiness  is characterized  by rhythmic backgrmmd  theta.   Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.   At the close of the sleep recording, there is an independent right mid temporal sharp wave followed a second later by a left mid temporal sharp wave. Photic stimulation  is performed while the patient is relatively drowsy.  At this time, there are additional  sharp waves seen again separated  by a few seconds seen in the right and left temporal  region.   These  are higher  ampl.itude than one  would  expect in a nmmal variant.  Photic stimulation does elicit brief bilateral driving.
HR:   54BPM
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Independent rare right and left temporal sharp waves
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  This BEG supports  a localization  related  mechanism for epilepsy.   Although there were Â·rare sharp waves, they were viewed from the left and from the right and this EEG must be considered epileptogenic in nature.  The sharp waves are higher an1plitude than one wou ld expect for a benign variant.
