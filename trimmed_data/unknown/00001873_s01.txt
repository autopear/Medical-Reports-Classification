MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Valium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed. The patient is described as having difficulty cooperating.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   As the tracing opens, the patient is sitting comfortably. He has difficulty cooperating,  cannot follow commands and has frequent bruxism or other oral automatisms. At times the 9-Hz posterior dominant rhythm is identified bilaterally but there is also some theta mixed in the background, sometimes disrupting the alpha rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG becomes a little bit more synchronous and some of the muscle artifact drops out. This is followed by spontaneous  arousals and then more muscle and chewing. Photic stimulation is remarkable  for a lot of chew artifacts. As the patient tries to drift off to sleep on photic stimulation he has head nodding and more muscle artifact.
	HR: 	84 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Mild excess background  theta and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were observed today. To more completely evaluate this individual's epilepsy, a repeat tracing capturing sleep is suggested. This might also help alleviate some of the muscle artifact. Clinical evaluation may be helpful to determine if this is part of an extrapyramidal side effect, bruxism or another abnormality.
