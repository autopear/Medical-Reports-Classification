MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Digoxin, and Baclofen.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is sweating and somewhat uncooperative.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in this state demonstrates a mixed frequency pattern rich in beta, theta, and smaller amounts of alpha frequency.  Spontaneous arousals are noted.  Testing is not performed to attempt maximum responsiveness.  The patient is, however, stimulated.  At some point during the tracing the technologist noted that the patient had right hand shaking.  Reviewing the video, the technologist put the EEG camera on the left hand and comments that there is no shaking seen.  
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The behavior in question is not associated with an EEG change.
