MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Benadryl, Cogentin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is somnolent and when aroused.  The EEG demonstrates significant muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  When undisturbed, the background EEG is primarily a lower voltage theta pattern with increasing amounts of delta as she drifts off to sleep.  It is a relatively low voltage record, slightly more featureless on the right compared to the left.  Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact  
HR:    120 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
Low voltage slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The technical qualities of this record as well as the background muscle artifact precludes an acceptable evaluation in search of focal features.  There were no epileptiform features noted.
