MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lisinopril, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal.  There is continuous focal slowing from the right occipital/posterior temporal region with sharp waves seen at T6/O2.  There is a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm, higher amplitude on the right than the left and overall the inherent appearance of a craniotomy, although that is not part of this patient’s history.  The overall background is one of theta with intermittent bursts of rhythmic generalized delta.  There are also occasional bursts of shifting, arrhythmic delta and rare triphasic waves seen in this background. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the background and an increase in background slowing. There is also an increase in background beta.  In drowsiness, there is almost a poly spike component to the epileptiform activity seen from the right occipital region and there are one or two occasions where it has a more generous field of spread in the right hemisphere.  There are rare sharp waves seen in sleep from the left posterior temporal region as well.  
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Right occipital spike and slow wave activity. 
Rare left posterior temporal sharp and slow wave activity.
Generalized background slowing and occasional FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform activity is not as prominent than in some of this patient’s records, but is more remarkable than previous studies, which were recorded when she was seizure-free.  This tracing continues to support a partial  mechanism for epilepsy in a process which may involve both hemispheres.
