MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   The  background EEG  is  low-to-medium amplitude, diffusely slow, with a mixture of theta, beta, and delta.   Stimulation of the patient produces a dramatic increase in muscle artifact.  In this low voltage record, there is greater artifact noted in the right frontal region.
HR:  90BPM.
Il\1PRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, slow pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal features in the 1ight frontal region may be due to the skull defect.  Of note, the record demonstrates an increasingly rich alpha ru1d  theta
frequency activity towards the end of the study compatible with an improving process.
