INTRODUCTION: 
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior 
temporal electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep stage I and stage II were recorded and photic stimulation and hyperventilation activation procedures were performed. 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: 
Frequent T4 electrode artifact 
MEDICATIONS: 
Dilantin. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The record opens to a well-formed 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetrically reactive to eye opening and closing. There is a small amount of frontocentral beta. Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage I. Activating procedures 
including hyperventilation and photic stimulation did not produce any abnormal discharges. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
None.
