MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. Frontal skull defect is noted by the technologist.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is little in the way of a breach rhythm identified.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude of the background and perhaps accentuating some faster frequency activity in the frontal regions.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements, as well as bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.  In the drowsy record, there are not only bursts of rhythmic frontal delta, but there is a very scant amount of shifting frontal delta. With the use of additional montages, there are bursts of frontally predominant delta activity, which are high amplitude.  With the use of different montages including average reference, there is frontally predominant delta with a slightly asymmetric field, slightly more maximum to the right and with what appears to be an underlying Fz sharp wave.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and, in fact, could be in and out of stage II sleep.  There is no definite driving response. 
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Frontal delta with an underlying Fz or frontal midline sharp wave and a slight predominance to the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: FIRDA can be a normal finding as an individual drops off to sleep, particularly in an older adult; however, in this context, this cannot be considered a normal finding particularly as there appears to be an underlying sharp wave.
