EEG after admission. Past medical history: C5 spinal injury status post surgery, parietal 
occipital hematoma. 
MEDICATIONS: Decadron, Nexium, and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement and with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is not intubated. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrated disorganized 
pattern with generalized slow delta activity, more slower on the left side, background 
higher amplitude higher on the left side. Sharp waveswas also observed on the right 
side. Isolated low amplitude sharp waves were observed at T3-T5. During the EEG 
recording, the patient had spontaneous eye movement, but stimulation does not 
activate the record. 
HR: 140 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. High amplitude generalized background slow. 
2. Sharp wave·s were at T3-T5. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform seizure has dramatically improved. The 
patient follows simple· commands despite generalized background slow. This supports 
the diagnosis of chronic encephalopathy.
