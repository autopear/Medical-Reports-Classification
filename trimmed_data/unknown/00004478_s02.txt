MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Coumadin.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a 1 hour EEG awake and sleep study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During wakefulness,  there was well-organized posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz of 60 microvolts.
the record showed by increased slowing and some theta activity.   During
hyperventilation, there was no activation, but she fell asleep during and vertex waves are seen.  There is no driving seen during photic stimulation, and again she is falling asleep during the study.  Stage 2 sleep is seen with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.
HR:  84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is no focal or epileptiform features observed on this record.  A normal EEG does not include the diagnosis of epilepsy.
