MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric, continuous, but mildly disorganized.  There is a 12 Hz, 10 to 15 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is attenuated with eyes opened. There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, producing an increase in the slow activity of theta in the frontal region.  Post-hyperventilation, the activity returns to baseline within two minutes. Sleep is not achieved in this tracing.  Photic stimulation elicits driving, but no abnormal responses.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	Mildly disorganized background.
	Excessive beta activity seen throughout the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The above findings are non-specific.  The increased beta activity may be due to medication or long-term alcohol use.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
