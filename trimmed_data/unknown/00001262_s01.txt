MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were perfom1ed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the alpharhytlu11is 8.5 Hz, 30-40 uV. There is a small an1ount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. There is a scant amount of theta activity in wakefulness.
Drowsiness is characterized by bitemporal wicket and slow rolling eye movement.  . Hyperventilation  produces  occasional bursts of 1ight temporal beta.   Photic stimulation  elicits
symmetric driving response.
HR: 72BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal focal slowing in hyperventilation
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptifom1features were seen. A structural or functional abnormality on the right can be considered. To further identify epileptifom1 activity, a repeat record with sleep is reconm1ended.
