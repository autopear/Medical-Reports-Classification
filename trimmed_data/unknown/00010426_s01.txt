MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Ativan, Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. In the initial sections of the record, the patient is quite tenuous on oxygen facemask but toward the close of the record, more alert. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording begins, the primary frequency in the background is lower voltage theta and beta. As the recording continues as he wakes up, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm but generous beta. Frontal craniotomy defect is noted particularly in the left frontal region and there is also lower voltage somewhat featureless delta pattern observable in the frontal regions. 
HR: 50 to 70 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing improving somewhat toward the close of the record. 
2. Frontal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. No epileptiform features are noted.
