MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Lovenox 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very sleepy, drifting in and out of stage II sleep. She also has a tremor in her head and chin when sitting up. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In limited wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm. The patient rapidly drifts into stage I sleep with posts and abundant stage II sleep with vertex waves, spindles and posts. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep but does elicit a driving-response. 
HR: 72 bpm, occasional PVC's. 
IMPRESSION: 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this EEG. The patient's medications or sleep deprivation could both account for her excessive sleepiness.
