MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is somnolent.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry.  There is a clear breach rhythm on the right with the right hemisphere demonstrating initially primarily theta and delta with some sharply contoured activity and/or sharp waves in the right frontotemporal region.  Initially, the patient is stimulated, producing an arousal pattern with an increase in faster frequency activity and some muscle artifact.  After this, the patient drifts off to sleep and occasional vertex waves and K complexes are identified.  By the close of the record, the EEG is richer in faster frequency activity.  The sharp activity from the right is not significantly changed, but there is a bit more beta and theta frequency activity, right more so then left.
HR:  56 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Foca, and  at times periodic delta and/or sharp waves from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  Of note, this patientâ€™s EEG seems to show some improvement in the overall background as the recording continues, as would be expected in a postictal state.
