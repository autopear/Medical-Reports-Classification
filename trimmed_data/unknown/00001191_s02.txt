OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is a slowing of the background 
with a posterior rhythm of 5.6 Hz seen bilaterally. The record originally opens up with a slowing 
of the background with theta seen bilaterally. The patient becomes a little bit more responsive to 
stimulation with an increase in faster frequency but still in full range. There is also right central 
arrhythmic delta activity seen as the patient becomes drowsy. It is seen in the parietal regions. 
There is increase of this theta delta pattern that increases when patient falls asleep. Deeper 
stages of sleep are seen with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles. During drowsiness this 
delta activity in the central parietal region on the right seems to come sharply contoured. 
HR: 82 bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Right central parietal ADA expressly seen in drowsiness. 
2. Sharply contoured delta seen in the central parietal region on the right. 
3. Posterior dominant rhythm in the theta range of 5.6 Hz. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is sharply contoured delta seen especially in drowsiness on 
the right parietal area which could be consistent with the previous history of meningioma but 
also could be consistent with a focus of epilepsy. Slowing of the 
background could also be consistent with previous history but is nonspecific.
