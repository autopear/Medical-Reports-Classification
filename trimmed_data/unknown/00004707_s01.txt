MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Aricept, Diovan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of excess background theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is somewhat irregular theta seen from the temporal regions, left greater than right.  Features of stage I sleep include vertex waves and K complexes.  The patient had an episode of chewing, occurring while awake, with spontaneous purposeful movements and not associated with EEG changes.  
HR:  72 BPM, occasionally irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Mild excess theta.
Asymmetry seen in the transition to sleep with a bit more focal slowing from the left.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were seen in this record.  The patient had some chewing movements, but these were not associated with ictal features on the EEG.  The absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
