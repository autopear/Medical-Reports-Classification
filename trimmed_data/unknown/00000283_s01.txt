MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake and responsive to stimuli. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an alpha rhythm of 10 Hz, 30 microvolts on the right. There is an intra-hemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left. The alpha rhythm is a little lower amplitude on the left, which is a normal finding, but as the patient becomes drowsy, occasional left posterior low voltage 3-4 Hz activity is observed. The patient seems to be quite drowsy and transitioning in and out of stage II sleep with K complexes followed by arousals. Stimulation of the patient results in an awake pattern. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Subtle focal slowing, most notable characterized by left posterior 3-4 Hz activity in the transition to sleep. 
2. Paroxysmal bursts of stage II sleep. 
3. Paroxysmal bursts of delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The focal slowing described is congruent with the intracerebral hemorrhage described above. No epileptiform features are seen. The bursts of generalized background slowing may be part of this acute 
intracerebral hemorrhage. However, the patient appears to be quite drowsy, and it may also be part of a pattern of sleep deficit or hypersomnolence.
