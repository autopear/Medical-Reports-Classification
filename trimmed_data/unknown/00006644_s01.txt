MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Percocet.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has difficulty cooperating with the study.  A substantial craniotomy scar is noted in the left central, temporal, and occipital scalp regions.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an identifiable posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz seen primarily on the right, but with some volume conduction to the left.  There is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity identified in the left hemisphere, most prominent in the temporal regions.  There is occasional, shifting right or left frontal slowing.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation perhaps elicits a driving response on the right.  
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	At times almost continuous arrhythmic delta activity from the left hemisphere maximum in the mid-to-anterior temporal regions.
	Disruption of the alpha rhythm on the left.
	Occasional right frontal delta.
	Rare left temporal sharp waves, which range from mid-to-posterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The overwhelming features for this EEG support a structural abnormality in the left hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions.  These findings are more or less congruent with the imaging and support a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
