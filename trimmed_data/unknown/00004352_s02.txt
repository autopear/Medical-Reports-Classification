MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Mannitol, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Fosphenytoin. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. A sensitivity of 2 uV/mm is employed.  Actual doses of medications are not recorded.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low voltage pattern with scant cerebral activity.  There is some low voltage beta frequency activity and some delta picked up in the right posterior quadrant.  There is some scant alpha frequency activity identified from the left central region.  
HR:  114 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Low voltage suppressed background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a small amount of cerebral activity.  This occurs in various isolated regions.  Correlation with imaging may be valuable.  
Long-Term EEG Monitoring, May 11, 2006 to May 12, 2006
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This EEG is reviewed with a sensitivity of 2 and 3 uV/mm.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is little in the way of definite cerebral activity.  There seems to be some very low voltage delta in the right posterior quadrant.  There is variability in the record, and at 22:54, there is what may well be an isolated sharp wave in the right anteriotemporal region in addition to some EKG artifact.  Given the nature of this patientâ€™s injury, breach activity is possible.  This EEG continues with a markedly low voltage record with scant cerebral activity.  The recording concludes at 11:20 AM.  At that time, the EEG demonstrates a very, very low voltage pattern with scant cerebral activity, particularly from the frontotemporal regions.  No reactivity to external stimuli is seen at that time.
