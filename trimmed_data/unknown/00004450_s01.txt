MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Clonazepam, Lipitor, Zoloft, and antihypertensives.  
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric, but mildly slow.  There is a 7 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  In the transition from wakefulness to stage II sleep, there are bursts of high amplitude slow theta and delta activity, lasting maximally six seconds.  Hyperventilation produces increased bursts of high amplitude delta activity.  Occasional frontal slow wave activity with shifting left or right frontal spike wave complexes are seen.  Photic stimulation also increases the burst of delta activity, but without slow spike wave complexes.  
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing with excessive theta activity with an alpha activity of only 8 Hz.  
Bursts of generalized delta activity.
Frontal slow waves with shifting left or right frontal spike wave activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern suggests cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter and possibly deep gray matter, interfering with thalamocortical interaction.  This pattern can be seen in patients with a toxic or metabolic derangement, or generalized epilepsy.  It may also be linked to the localization of secondarily generalized epilepsy.  It would be unusual in an inherited PGE.  A follow-up EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep is recommended.
