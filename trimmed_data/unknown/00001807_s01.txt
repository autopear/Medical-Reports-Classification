MEDICATIONS: Dilantin,-'Heparin; Atenolol, Nexium, Tylenol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat disorganized 
with a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing with some shifting slowing. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. 
HR: 66 bpm, and somewhat irregular
. 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild background slowing and disorganization. 
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are non-specific and support a biÂ­hemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. If epilepsy is an important consideration, repeat tracing and capturing deeper stages of sleep or comparison with previous studies is advised.
