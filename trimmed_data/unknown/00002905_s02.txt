	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, Ativan, others.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	As the tracing begins the patient is resting comfortably with eyes open. The background includes a state of frequency pattern with some arrhythmic delta activity from the left temporal region. In a sharp-wave contoured record, there are some clearly defined left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves maximum at T1/F7. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in alpha frequency activity in the background. Features of stage I sleep
		include vertex waves, due to technical difficulties, the remainder of this 	EEG. Multiple spontaneous arousals from sleep are observed. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. 	The remainder of the record demostrates intermittent focal slowing from the left.
	HR: 	72 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1 Generalized background slowing
2 Shifting arrhythmic delta activity
3 Left temporal sharp waves
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and raises the possibility of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
