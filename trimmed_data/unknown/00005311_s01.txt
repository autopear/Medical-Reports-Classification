MEDICATIONS: Celexa, Abilify, Dilantin, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite drowsy and not particularly cooperative. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record captures a drowsy or stage II sleep with vertex waves, spindles, hyper synchronous slowing. The patient has eye movements that persist into stage II sleep and the sleep pattern is quite fragmented with transitions in and out of sleep. The waking record that is identified includes excess theta. No epileptiform features were identified. 
HR: 78 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess theta. 
2. Background disorganization. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Profound sleep deprivation could produce the fragmented sleep described above. The same findings have also been seen in other psychiatric disturbances such as depression which can produce persistent eye movements into sleep.
