MEDICATIONS: Zantac, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Plavix, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record in a lethargic patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  When she is maximally awake, the background is poorly organized with generous background theta activity and a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz.  The remainder of the record includes a drowsy pattern with primarily slower theta frequency activity and delta.  There is some frontally predominant fast activity identified in the record.  
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing with poor organization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is this patient’s fourth EEG.  All EEGs have identified generalized background slowing with poor organization and none have identified epileptiform activity.  If localization of this patient’s epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing when current medical problems have resolved, in the lab, could be useful.
