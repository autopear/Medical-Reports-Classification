INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode system of placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD
In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta with some rhythmic central theta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude and a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits no significant driving.
HR 80 bpm
IMPRESSION
EEG within normal limits
CLINICAL CORRELATION 
No focal nor epileptiform features are observed.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  this EEG may be correlated with previous studies.
