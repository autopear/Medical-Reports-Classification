MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Neurontin.  Ascol.
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ER using standing 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is sedated. This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and fairly well organized. There is a 10 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm and a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Sleep was characterized by spindles and K complexes. 
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal features or epileptiform discharges were seen in this tracing.  Normal EEG does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG or long-term monitoring may be helpful to identify the seizure type and location of the epileptic focus.
