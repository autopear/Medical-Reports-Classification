	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, Ativan, Narcan.
	INTRODUCTION:	Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the emergency room using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with
1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated, unresponsive. Slow rolling eye
movements are observed.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	The overall background is very low voltage. There is prominent, frontal, slow rolling eye movements.
Parts of the record include generous muscle. With the use of increased sensitivity (3 UV/nm), a pattern of very low voltage, mixed theta and delta is observed. Stimulation of the patient seems to produce an increase in beta in the background.
HR: 120 bpm
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly low voltage and suppressed pattern.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This is a hyperacute pattern, but does suggest a severe disturbance of cerebral function. Factors can include this patient's acute metabolic problem as well as his CNS acting medication. The observation of reactivity as well as the presence of some mixed frequency activity in the background, despite the low voltage pattern, are positive features. If this patient's clinical status does not improve, additional recording may be of use.
