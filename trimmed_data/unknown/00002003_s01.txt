MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Morphine, Serax. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is comatose, intubated, and agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern, rich in beta frequency activity as well as frontally predominant 0.75 to 1 Hz delta activity.  There is superimposed, diffuse theta activity.  There is variability in the background with some portions of the record demonstrating more beta then others.  The beta frequency activity is richest in the central regions and the theta in the temporal regions.  There are shifting asymmetries with some of the slower delta seen on the right. 
HR:  56 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting asymmetries and shifting, slow arrhythmic delta. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The presence of reactivity and variability are positive prognostic features.  This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  There are no epileptiform features and no strongly lateralizing features.
