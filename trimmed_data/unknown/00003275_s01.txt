MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, steroids, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Portable digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and continuous, with superimposed excessive theta and a small amount of delta activity.  There is an 8 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm, and mildly increased excessive beta activity.  As the tracing continues, sharp activity at T3 and C3 is observed.  Occasionally, alternative sharp activity is seen at C3 and C4.  Sleep is not achieved in this tracing.  
HR:  126 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Background slowing.
	Mildly slowed alpha activity.
	Sharp activity in the left central region, and alternatively in the right and left central regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern is suggestive of a cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The focal findings of sharp waves provide the evidence of cortical irritation and may be responsible for seizures in this patient.  However, no clinical seizure behavior was correlated on the video camera.
