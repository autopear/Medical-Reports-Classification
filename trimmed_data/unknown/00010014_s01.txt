MEDICATIONS: Midazolam, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is described as intubated and unresponsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates continuous, low voltage pattern with generous beta. The beta is most prominent in the frontocentral regions. Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with higher amplitude beta and alpha frequency activity. 
HR: 96 to 104 bpm, slightly irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a beta frequency pattern. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. The midazolam drip would be expected to produce the pattern described above. No epileptiform features were seen.
