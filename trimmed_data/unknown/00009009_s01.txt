MEDICATIONS: Prevacid, Trazodone, Trizivir, Isoniazide, Metoclopramide, insulin, Dilantin, Magace, Cipro, Aggrenox, Risanpin, and Vireat.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and lethargic record.  Photic stimulation was performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the EEG record unfolds, the pattern is slow and disorganized.  With maximum stimulation, the background shows a 7 Hz alpha rhythm. There is intermittent generalized slowing with slower theta and delta rhythms seen.  There is right more than left independent anterior temporal sharp waves of up to 100 V amplitude.  Most are at F8/T2, rarely at T2 T6 with independent T1/F7sharps.  There is no significant focal slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits mild driving. 
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Overall slow background activity.
Generalized slowing, slower theta and delta rhythm.
Right more than left independent anterior temporal sharp waves of up to 100 V amplitude.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports an partial or focal mechanism for seizures.  No significant focal slowing is observed.
