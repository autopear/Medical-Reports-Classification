INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in Jab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation were performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 10.5 
hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. 
Features of drowsiness include and increase in background theta. The patient starts to 
fall asleep in photic stimulation. A scant driving response Is noted in photic stimulation. 
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in theta. 
HR: 60 to 80 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal 
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
