MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lipitor, Ditropan, and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in the amplitude of the background as well as a small degree of background slowing.  Following HV, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is prominent temporal wicket.  Other features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. 
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.  
HR:  62 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If appropriate, a follow-up study may be of use.
