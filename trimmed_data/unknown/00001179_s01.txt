MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Dilaudid, Reglan, Lorazepam, Zofran 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is performed. This is an extremely drowsy individual. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The majority of the record includes a drowsy pattern but with maximum wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz posterior dominant. The overall pattern includes excess theta and occasional bursts of shifting or bilateral delta. Snore artifact and vertex waves are noted. Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort 
and does not significantly activate the record. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: 
1. A small amount of excess theta and background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing described above may be due to this patient's medications, metabolic disturbance, or postictal state. No epileptiform features were noted.
