MEDICATIONS:   Morphine, Dilantin,  Famotidine, Lopressor
Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 systolic murmur of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is awake, somewhat agitated and keeps looking from side-to-side. When maximally awake, the background includes primarily a state of frequency pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 6 Hz at best with intermittent bursts of somewhat irregular, bilateral fundal delta which is slower in frequency in the right frontal region in comparison to the left.
	HR:	84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
	2.	Bursts of generalized delta which are slower on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both hemispheres. The slower delta on the right is congruent with the neurosurgical history. No sharp waves were observed.
