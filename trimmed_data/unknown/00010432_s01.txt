MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid, gabapentin, tramadol, nifedipine, Prilosec, vitamin B, and insulin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies of lower amplitude anteriorly.  During sleep, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates,  there is an increase in the amount of theta and beta activity, and a brief period of sleep spindles is captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
FINDINGS:  
No epileptiform discharges.
Brief stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly asleep 22-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
