MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record demonstrates a low voltage 
pattern with stage 1 and stage 2 sleep. Brief arousals produce scant alerting with a 9 Hz 
posterior dominant rhythm. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The excessive 
drowsiness and the generous beta may be correlated clinically. If epilepsy is an 
important consideration a follow-up outpatient study may be considered.
