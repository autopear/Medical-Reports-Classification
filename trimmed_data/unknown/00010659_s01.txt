MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9.25 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a scan amount of background theta in the record seen bilaterally. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definite epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If characterization of this patientâ€™s epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing sleep is recommended.  The scant amount of theta described above is within normal limits.
