MEDICATIONS: Topamax and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8 to 10 Hz, 40 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces diffuse paroxysmal slowing in the left temporal area more so than the right.  Following hyperventilation, the patient falls into stage I sleep identified by vertex waves with accentuation of the delta activity, left temporal area more than right with occasional sharp waves.  Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving.  
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional left temporal sharp waves.
Hyperventilation producing left temporal slowing more than the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The above findings in this tracing are supportive of this patientâ€™s seizures. If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep would be useful.
