 
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Awake and drowsy study. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE During wakefulness, the background rhythm shows 
increased muscle artifact and lacks regular adult morphology. There is an increased 
beta activity seen and when the muscleÂ· artifact clears a predominant delta theta pattern 
is seen. During stimulation of the patient, there is an increase in the background to 
more of a theta pattern, some times reaching 4-5 H:z. During the video the patient is 
moving her-right arm. 
HR: 64 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized slowing of the background, originally initially of a delta pattern but 
increasing to theta with stimulation. 
2. Overall lack of regular adult morphology in an awake record. 
CLINICAL There is no epileptiform activity seen on this record. The 
overall background is slow and lacks normal morphology. This could be consistent with 
a history of postictal state or dementia but is non-specific.
