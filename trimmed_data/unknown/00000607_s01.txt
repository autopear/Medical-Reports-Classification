MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, antihypertensives, Paxil. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with rhythmic central theta activity. Hyperventilation was performed with good effort producing an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving at intermediate flash frequencies.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage I sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep or recording one of the patientâ€™s events could be useful.
