MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Heparin, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly slow with a mixture of arrhythmic delta, theta, and smaller amounts of beta.  In the initial portions of the record, there are independent, right or left temporal sharp waves and/or spike waves, some of which reach amplitudes of 100 V. Duration ranges from 70 to 400 milliseconds, depending on montage use.  With the use of a referential montage, there appears to be attenuation of faster frequency activity identified from the left temporal region, although this finding is not identified in all montages.  There is variability in the record, with some sections of the record demonstrating more significant arrhythmic delta than others.  Other sections demonstrate bursts of brief beta frequency activity, particularly in the frontotemporal regions.  
Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity, but wakefulness is not sustained.  In the initial seconds where the tech stimulates the patient, there is an electrodecrimental response.  	
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing, intermittent generalized attenuation, and intermittent left temporal focal slowing as well as independent, right and left high amplitude temporal spike and slow wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function as well as a focal mechanism for seizures and a structural process on the left.
