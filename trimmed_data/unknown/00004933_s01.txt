MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, and Betalol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz, 50 uV in a background with excess theta and a modest degree of background disorganization. There are prominent bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity identified from either hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions.  These are sharply contoured, but there is no definite spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave activity underlying this.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta some of which is notched, but again without definitive spike and slow wave activity.  
Photic stimulation elicits a photoelectric effect and a minimal driving response. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing and disorganization. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and support a mild, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  In this sharply contoured background, no definite epileptiform activity was seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up, more prolonged sleep study may be valuable.
