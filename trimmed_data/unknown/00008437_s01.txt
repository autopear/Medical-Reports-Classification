patient reports confusion, headache, foaming from her mouth and shaking. PMH: 
Diabetes, hypertension, renal failure on hemodialysis. 
MEDICATIONS: Prednisone, Heparin, Dilantin, Minoxidil, Diovan, Amlodipine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient appears to be quite drowsy. She 
wakes up and drifts off to stage 2 sleep and then arouses again. In maximal 
wakefulness, the background EEG is slow with approximately 6.5 to 7 Hz frequency 
activity. In early drowsiness, the activity is somewhat disorganized and there is a subtle 
asymmetry in the occipital regions with a bit more slower delta from the right than the 
left but this is a very subtle finding. Intermittent epochs of stage 2 sleep include vertex 
wave spindles and are followed immediately by arousal. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild background slowing. 
CLINICAL The transitions to and from stage 2 sleep are nonspecific 
and can be seen in an underlying encephalopathy, sleep deprivation or a disorder either 
of sustained wakefulness or her disorder of sleep with inability to sustain sleep. In this 
individual with a right occipital infarct, there was little in the way of focal pathology and 
no sharp waves nor spikes were observed today.
