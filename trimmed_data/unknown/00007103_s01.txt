MEDICATION: Dilantin, Depakote, Morphine, Dilaudid, Ambien, others. 
ACTIVATION: Photic Stimulation. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was perfo1med in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz, 40uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta with vertex waves in stage II sleep. Ve1iex waves, K-complexes and spindles are seen in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation elicits lovely bilateral driving. 
HR: 78BPM. 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are seen in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, additional testing may be valuable.
