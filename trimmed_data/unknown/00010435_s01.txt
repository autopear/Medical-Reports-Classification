MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, aspirin, insulin, and blood pressure medications.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital  video  EEG  is  perfonned  in the  lab using  standard  10-20 system  of electrode  placement  with one chru.mel of EKG.  Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake a11d drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION   OF  THE   RECORD:   In wakefulness,   the  background   EEG   is somewhat disorganized  with mainly a theta rhythm.  There is some shifting frontal delta. Occasional   left   temporal   focal   slowing   is  associated   with  rare  T3   sharp   waves. Drowsiness  is characterized by increased  background  slowing.    The patient is intermittently agitated.
HR:  66BPM.
IMPR ESSION: Abnmmal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized background slowing.
2.   Intermittent  frontal delta.
3.   Shru.-p waves in the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION: The above findings could be secondary to the old CVA with  acute  change  in  mental  status  and  sharp  waves.     Evaluation  for  seizures  1s appropriate.
