MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 12 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits a generous photic driving response. 
HR:    72 beats bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features identified. The generous beta and the generous photic driving response are normal phenomena.
