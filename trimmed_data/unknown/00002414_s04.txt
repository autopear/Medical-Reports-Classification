MEDICATIONS: Clonidine, Keppra, ASA, Metoprolol 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a bedside record. 
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. 
OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with a 
fair amount of muscle and frequent eye blink in the background. As the recording 
continues, the patient is a bit more cooperative and the muscle artifact drops out The 
primary frequencies in the background when the patient is relaxed are primarily a theta 
frequency background. 
HR: 96 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The previously described left frontocentral focal slowing is 
more difficult to identify today. The background slowing has been identified in the 
1 1/4/2010 EEG. The EEG of 11/22/2010 was not available for comparison . This EEG is 
improved as compared to the October 31, 2010, EEG which demonstrated a slower 
background with sharp waves identified from either hemisphere.
