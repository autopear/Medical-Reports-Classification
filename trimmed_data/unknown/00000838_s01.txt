MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In maximum wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Early drowsiness as seen in the initial section of the record is remarkable for a slower posterior dominant rhythm of 8 to 8.5 Hz, but with the patient stimulated at the close of the record the alpha is clearly faster.  Features of drowsiness also include slow rolling eye movements.  Photic stimulation elicits:  Bilateral driving.
	HR:	60-70 bpm, Irregular
IMPR ESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORR  ELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed.  Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
