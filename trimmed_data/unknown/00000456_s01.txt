MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system  of  electrode  placement  with  one  channel  of  EKG.  The  child  is  awake  and enjoying his bottle.  The date of the seizures of the status epilepticus is not provided.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.   Drowsiness is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.   There are a handful of vertex waves as the child becomes sleepier.  Lateral rectus eye artifact is noted in the background.
HR:  132BPM.
IMPRESSION: Nom1al EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptifom1 features were identified in this record. The normal developmental milestones for a child of this age have been met.
