MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, aspirin, Heparin, thiamin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient who varies between drowsiness and restlessness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are brief portions of the record where the patient is maximally alert and a low voltage 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is identified.  During much of the waking record, there is bilateral excess theta.  In addition, temporal wicket is seen.  There is intermittent, arrhythmic temporal slowing identified, left greater than right.  Features of stage I sleep include vertex waves.  As the recording continues in this postictal patient, the overall background organization improves and the focality is more left temporal than right.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Initially, bihemispheric slowing.
Shifting temporal slowing, which by the close of the record is most prominent on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This tracing supports a dynamic process, which seems to be improving over time and may reflect a postictal state.   Correlation with neuroimaging is recommended.
