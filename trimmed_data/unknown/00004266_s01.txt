MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Hydralazine, ASA, Versel 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake, drowsy. She 
is described as lethargic and confused. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is an alternating pattern of 
more rhythmic theta with smaller amounts of delta alternating with more arrhythmic 
delta. The arrhythmic delta activity is more prominent when the patient is a bit agitated. 
Independent right and left temporal sharp waves are observed. Those from the right 
hemisphere are well defined and associated with after going slow waves. They typically 
occur independently. Those from the left are seen more prominently in the initial 
sections of the record and have a more irregular quasi periodic morphology. 
Stimulation of the patient is associated with the arrhythmic delta activity. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Independent right and left temporal sharps 
2. Irregular delta 
3. Background slowing 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is c/w localization mechanism for seizures as 
well as bihemispheric dysfunction.
