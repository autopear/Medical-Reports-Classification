MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible. The patient is on 1:1 observation. This is an awake and sleep record.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient alternates between being drowsy and agitated. When he is awake, he has a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with excess beta and theta. He has occasional bursts of frontally predominantly delta. Features of sleep include increase in beta and increase in delta. The patient is sitting up, uncooperative, and the EEG remains somewhat slow. A single electrode artifact is noted at T6. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess background theta.
2. Slowing of alpha rhythm. 
3. Disorganization. 
4. FIRDA 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific which could possibly be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. HIV or drug overdose can contribute to this factor.
