MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: This video EEG is performed in the laboratory using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one-channel of EKG. Hypoventilation and photic 
stimulation were performed. This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous symmetric and 
fairly well-organized. There is a 10 Hz, 13 mcV posterior dominant alpha rhythm which 
well attenuates with his eyes opened. There is a small amount of low voltage fast beta 
activity in the frontal and central area. Hypoventilation did not change his background 
significantly. However, no sleeping stages were achieved in this tracing. Photic 
stimulation created driving, but no epileptiform or abnormal discharges noted. 
Heart rate 60 beats per minute. 
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If 
epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG with sleeping activation may be helpful.
