MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record. In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with a 9 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Without stimulation, he drifts off to sleep with rhythmic theta.  The patient sustains wakefulness through photic stimulation.  At that time, in this low voltage record, there is intermittent theta identified from the left hemisphere, maximum in the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Mild excess background theta in apparent wakefulness. 
Subtle focal slowing with beta from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific, but consideration for a mild, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a structural or functional abnormality on the left would be appropriate.
