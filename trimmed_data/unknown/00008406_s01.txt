MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Dilantin, mannitol, propofol, Keppra, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Patient is intubated and not 
responsive. Patient was noted to have rigors, or other involuntary movements one day 
prior to this EEG. Intubated, comatose, poorly responsive. Skull fracture with frontal 
lobe hemorrhages and multiple orbital and facial fractures. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and 
includes a mixture of delta frequency activities which range from 0.5 to 3 Hz. There is a 
little bit more faster delta in the frontal regions and some of the slower delta is in the 
posterior regions. There are minor shifting asymmetries, but the overall record is 
relatively symmetric. Eye movement is observed. Stimulation of the patient produces 
scant faster frequency activity. 
HR: 108 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with markedly slow delta activity. 
2. An asymmetry within that delta with more slow delta posteriorly. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral 
function affecting gray and white matter and may be correlated with imaging. This 
patient's medications may also play a role in the patterns described above but, overall, 
the medications would be expected to produce beta and very little beta was seen in the 
record.
