MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient is observed to have a skull defect on the right. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE R ECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 10-Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a small amount of background 8-Hz activity and some subtle focal slowing in the right hemisphere, particularly in the posterior quadrant.  At times this disrupts the alpha rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.   Towards the close of the record as the patient
awakens for hyperventilation, some of the right posterior temporal focal slowing is more
	prominent.  Bilateral driving response is observed. HR: 	84 bpm
IMPR  ESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
	1. 	Mild background slowing.
	2. 	Right posterior quadrant focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG carries an intermediate correlation of the structural functional abnormality on the right.  No epileptiform features were observed today.
