MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is asleep throughout much of the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The majority of this record demonstrates stage II sleep, which on the whole is symmetric with symmetric vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  There are rare, shifting asymmetries.  The transition to slow wave sleep was characterized by bursts of rhythmic high amplitude slow delta.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If there are questions regarding the maturational state of this childâ€™s EEG, additional recording with wakefulness may be of use.
