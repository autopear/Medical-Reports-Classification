MEDICATIONS: 12 mg of Ativan, 1000 mg of Dilantin, Clonidine, and Hydralazine. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ER using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There is a prominent asymmetry with sharply contoured activity identified from the frontal regions, but much more prominent in the right hemisphere with an unusual field of spread including O2 and FP2, F8.  There is significant faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere and the activity is much more attenuated from the left.  The periodic, sharply contoured activity does not wane as the recording continues.  In fact, there is essentially a pattern of continuous sharp waves with a periodicity of approximately 0.5 to 0.8. Stimulation of the patient does not attenuate this activity. 
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Ongoing, continuous periodic sharp waves maximal from the right hemisphere.
	Generalized slowing..  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports an ongoing, late ictal pattern.  Additional recording and intervention is appropriate.  These results were communicated to the clinical team.
