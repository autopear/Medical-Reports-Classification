MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Depakote, Dilantin, Propofol, and Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely low voltage.  It is slow and suppressed with intermittent delta activity at 0.3 to 1.0 Hz. Occasionally, PLEDS were recognized. Occasionally, bursts of poly spikes and GPFA without clinical motor seizures were identified. 
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal 72 hour video  EEG due to:
Background that is low voltage, diffusely slow and suppressed.
Intermittent, periodic delta activity of 0.3 to 1 Hz.
Occasional PLEDS.
Occasional bursts of poly spikes/GPFA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal 72-hour long-term monitoring EEG. Initially, the clinical seizures were well correlated with epileptiform discharges such as a burst of spike and slow waves lasting 30 to 90 seconds. Later on with the IV Propofol, the EEG pattern changed to intermittent, periodic delta activity without clinical seizures.  On the third day, the EEG was low voltage and suppressed with intermittent, periodic delta activity, suggesting postictal phase pattern or late status epilepticus  pattern. This pattern may be seen in severe cerebral dysfunction with bilateral brain damage or anoxic encephalopathy.
