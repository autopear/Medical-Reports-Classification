MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenobarbital, Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates essentially 
continuous high amplitude sharp waves in the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread including temporal, central and occipital region. They are present when the patient is awake and asleep and some times generate build up. It is difficult to determine if there is a clinical impact when the patient has clinical seizures. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. The seizure and spike detector has difficulty identifying the ictal build up, but it does identify the essentially continuous spiking. The EKG lead is off. 
SEIZURE EXAMPLE TIME: 13:12, the patient is lying in bed. He does not seem to do 
much during the seizure, however, he does seem to moan. 
HR: N/A 
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Ongoing, periodic complexes from the right 
hemisphere without significant improvement, but without the same pattern of ictal build up.
