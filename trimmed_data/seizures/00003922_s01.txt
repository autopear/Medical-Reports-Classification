MEDICATIONS: 
Dilantin, Vim pat. She is off the Versed drip now. 
INTRODUCTION: 
Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement at the bedside and 
one-channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The background is very slow with theta and delta frequency rates. It is slower and more sharply contoured on the right. 
There is arrhythmic delta on the right with stimulation. There seems to be some activation of the record and there was 
alerting response. There was a burst of fast beta range activity on the left at the end of the record, which could be a 
potential seizure at 9:26a.m. This lasted for about 30 seconds. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1 Very slow background. 
2. More slower and sharper on the right. 
3. Arrhythmic delta on the right. 
4. Burst of fast seizure like activity on the left. 
Clinical Correlation 
This is a mixed picture, could suggest severely injured brain. There is some variability in the record and reactivity. Ongoing observation 1s recommended at this time.
