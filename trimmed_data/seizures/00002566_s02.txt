MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Metoprolol, Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. A clinical seizure occurred on 5/23/09 during the 
EEG with twitching of the fingers, right eye deviation and tachycardia to a heart rate of 200. 
Seizure during this EEG with right eye blinking and eye deviation 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes 
an interhemispheric asymmetry. The primary frequencies in the background are stated with 
some delta, eye movement artifacts and triphasic waves. There are a handful of left anterior 
temporal sharp waves, but the most notable features in this EEG are a seizure, which begins at 
08:58:31, with repetitive sharp waves and frequency evolutions. A nurse stands in front of the 
patient during this seizure, but the seizure appears to be of one minute and 20 seconds in 
duration. Patient blinks repetitively is visible on the video. Prior to the seizure, the patient is 
described as somewhat responsive, and afterwards, additional background slowing on the right 
is seen, as well as intermittent sharp waves left or right. Tachycardia persists at the close of the 
record. 
HR: 160 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Clinical and electrographic seizure out of the right temporal region. 
2. Intermittent sharp waves, right or left. 
3. Background suppression. 
4. Interhemispheric asymmetry with more significant slowing on the right. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an epileptic disorder. Given the 
presence of a temporal lobe seizure, underlying epilepsy may be considered as well as reactive 
seizures.
