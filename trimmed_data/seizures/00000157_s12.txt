INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During this section of the record, the patient 
received levetiracetam and her propofol dose was titrated up. 
Seven electrographic seizures are noted. These are typically 2 minutes in duration and 
began with repetitive sharp activity in the left hemisphere, maximum in the temporal 
region. The activity can be frontotemporal with characteristic frequency evolution. 
Characteristics of the seizure Include eye blinking, drooling, and some facial twitching. 
The interictal record is continuous. The patient is no longer in burst suppression. There 
are some triangular frontal sharp waves, right more so than the left. 
In addition, interictal sharp activity is noted primarily with left anterior temporal sharp 
waves, although there are epileptiform discharges on the right. 
HR: 80 to 100 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Interval impression: The presence of only 7 complex partial seizures in 
a 24-hour epoch for this Individual represents an improvement.
