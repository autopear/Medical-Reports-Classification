MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. The recording started on 7/6/03 at 01:31:04 and ended on 7/7/03 at 07:41:31
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS/SLEEP: The background EEG is poorly organized with generalized slow activity, more prominent in the left hemisphere.  There is a breech rhythm on the left. Activity form the left includes theta and delta.  Activity from the right is a mixture of slower delta and theta.  
EVENTS: Two spells were captured as seizures:  
Time: 18:04 and the other at 18:08. The EEG at this time demonstrates diffuse delta,  There is no eye blink artifact.   The EEG did not identify epileptiform activity and no muscle artifact was seen.  After giving Ativan, slower activity was identified.  
Ativan at 21:31 and 00:37:56:  No clinical seizures are reported at this time and there is no S/W activity.  The background activity showed more slowing with low voltage beta and theta activity in the right hemisphere and a slight higher voltage theta and delta activity in the left hemisphere. More beta activity was identified after Ativan. 
HR:  108 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG to due:
	Background disorganization.
	Generalized slowing with a slightly higher voltage on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Abnormal EEG with markedly severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction,.  However, this recording did not reveal active electronic epileptiform activity. Beta activity after the patient received Ativan is a normal response to the medication.
