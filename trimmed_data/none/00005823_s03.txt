INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric, continuous, but very attenuated.  Maximum sensitivity significantly increased the muscle artifact.  The posterior alpha rhythm is hard to distinguish.  There is an increased amount of diffuse beta activity.   Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in the frontocentral slow activity, which is persistent post- HV up to two minutes.  Sleep is evidenced by a mixed frequency of brain activity, vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.  Photic stimulation elicits driving. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	Lack of alpha activity.
	Increased slow activity in hyperventilation and post-HV.
	Diffusely increased beta activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is of unclear clinical significance because the increased amount of beta activity is a non-specific finding.  The increased slow activity in hyperventilation persisting into post-HV may be ____________ abnormal significance, but no epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG would be warranted.
