MEDICATIONS:  Insulin drip and sedation.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. The patient was obtunded during the recording. No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens up to diffusely slow background in the 2-4 Hz and 20-40 mV amplitude which appears to react to tactile stimulation. No abnormal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta seen.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and 20-40 mV amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
