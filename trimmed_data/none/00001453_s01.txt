	M EDICATIONS: 	Aspirin, heparin, Nexium.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive but with stimulation alerts and demonstrates purposeful movements.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG demonstrates a markedly asymmetric pattern with a pattern from the left which is somewhat to moderately slow for age with a 7-8 hertz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of excess theta. The right hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta, particularly in the central and temporal regions. There is some periodic, sharply contoured slowing seen in the mid to posterior temporal region as well as right centrotemporal region.
There is a suspicious underlying sharp wave again centrotemporal/midÂ­
temporal. The potentially epileptiform activity in this record is relatively infrequent and never evolves. Features of drowsiness including increasing background slowing. HR: 90 BPM - Irregular.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous arrhythmic delta activity on the right.
	2. 	Some sharply contoured waveforms from the right hemisphere including T4, T6, C4.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right involving gray and white matter. Consideration for a potentially epileptogenic process is appropriate, although no seizures were recorded. There were no behavioral events during the record and although the patient was not verbally responsive she did demonstrate purposeful movements in response to tactile stimulation.
