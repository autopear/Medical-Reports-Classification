INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at beside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record demonstrates a lower voltage, 
relatively featureless section. The patient is undergoing procedures during the EEG. There is a 
significant amount of artifact and the background continues to demonstrate intermittent 
attenuations. In this case, in comparison to the record earlier in the day, the combination of 
rhythmic theta and delta is slower with slower theta frequency activity. When the EEG 
attenuates the attenuation is longer and more prominent. There are some T5 sharp waves that 
persist in the record. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing, overall worsening in comparison to earlier portions of the 
record, although it looks as if when the patient is stimulated this improves. 
2. Intermittent background attenuation. 
3. Left posterior temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. There is no indication that the 
patient received additional sedative hypnotic medications and in this context, this EEG supports 
worsening of the clinical state.
