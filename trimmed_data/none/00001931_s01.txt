MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy and extremely uncomfortable. She has left facial and temporal swelling from her acute fall. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG Includes a 8.5 Hz alpha 
rhythm in a background of generous beta. She starts to drift in and out of sleep. There is prominent fast activity in the frontal central regions. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in both beta and theta. There appear to be some focal features on the left, which unfortunately in the same region as the patient's acute injury. As the recording continues, electrode integrity improves, but there is higher amplitude theta and a little underlying delta again in the 
same region with modified electrodes. There is a suggestion of a left frontal central sharp wave, but without an after going slow waves and there are also some bursts of sharply contoured paroxysmal frontal higher amplitude theta frequency activity. On a handful of occasions there is prominent, frontally predominant sharply contoured 5-6 Hz activity, but not definitive spike and wave activity. 
HR: 110bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Excess beta. 
2. Excess theta. 
3. Question frontal predominantly 5-6 Hz frontal activity. 
4. In this acute post trauma patient with modified scalp electrodes with question of left frontal temporal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional EEG monitoring is suggested to more completely evaluate this patient's epileptiform activity. No seizures were recorded. The medications may play a role in the excess beta and the postictal state, as well as the head trauma may play a role in the theta.
