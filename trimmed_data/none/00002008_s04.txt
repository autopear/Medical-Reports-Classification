INTRODUCTION: 
2:54pm p. 1 
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one-channel 
EKG. 
This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The background EEG demonstrates a slow and disorganized pattern. 
There is a paroxysmal nature to this record with paroxysmal bursts of slowing and disorganization intermixed with other 
sections of the record when the EEG is reasonably well organized. When the EEG is reasonably well organized, the 
alpha remains somewhat slow. 
There are intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta, as well as left temporal focal slowing. Bursts of FIRDA, as well as eye 
blink are noted. 
The patient is somewhat restless No epileptiform features and no seizures are recorded during her periods of 
restlessness 
Heart rate 96 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: 
This remains an abnormal EEG with background slowing and disorganization. The left temporal sharp waves and the 
paroxysmal slowing, as well as the FIRDA are not associated with clinical seizures.
