MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed on this study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There was diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  There appears to be no focality, no frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture was seen. No activating procedures performed.
HR:    102 bpm
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplified 20-60 Muv.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Diffuse slowness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is non-specific in regard to etiology. It may be metabolic or toxic encephalopathy or bilateral white lesions.
