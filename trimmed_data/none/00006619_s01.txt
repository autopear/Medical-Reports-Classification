The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a nice amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures produce no clear abnormal discharges.
