	MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, Keppra, Zofran, others.
	INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU
using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated but coughing.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	Background EEG is diffusely slow. Portions of the record are obscured by muscle or other movement artifact. There is an asymmetry with a bit more slow arrhythmic delta activity on the right compared to the left. There is no mention of a craniotomy for this patient. Stimulation of the patient produces an increasing faster frequency activity.
	IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Slower arrhythmic delta activity on the right.
	CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	Previous EEGs are not available for comparison, but no epileptiform features were identified today and no seizures were recorded.
