MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Nexium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake.  The activity from the left hemisphere is mildly slow, but the right hemisphere demonstrates prominent sharp waves from the right hemisphere, some of which are periodic in nature with a generous field of spread, maximum in the right mid-temporal region but including the centrotemporal region.  They are seen with a periodicity of 0.5 to 1 Hz.  They persist as the patient becomes drowsy, becoming higher amplitude and more hemispheric in nature.  
HR:  78 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Periodic right hemispheric sharp waves with a maximum in the right mid-temporal region. 
	Superimposed focal slowing on the right. 
	Mild background slowing on the left.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a markedly irritative process in the right.  No seizures were recorded.  Additional EEG monitoring may be valuable.
