MEDICATIONS: 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient reports no seizures and no auras during this section of the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake.  The background EEG demonstrates generous beta.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with focal slowing from the right hemisphere particularly the centrotemporal region with evidence of a breach rhythm, as well as some theta in that area.   There are intermittent rhythmic bursts of theta from the left hemisphere, particularly the centrotemporal region, with spread to the right.  These are not sustained.  At 19:43, there is generous, somewhat rhythmic delta from the right frontocentral region.  There seems to be an underlying sharp wave picked up in the right frontocentral region.  This activity can be reformatted, and it seems to be maximum at C4, but with a generous field of spread.  Reviewing the data with an average reference, it is actually slightly higher amplitude at P4 than T4-T6.  In addition, the spike that we picked up at P4 has some variability in terms of its field.  There is also a transient with opposite polarity seen sometimes at F7, which may in fact be contralateral to something in the right parietal region.  Additional sharp waves out of this background show C4 and P4 to be nearly the same amplitude in an average reference.
