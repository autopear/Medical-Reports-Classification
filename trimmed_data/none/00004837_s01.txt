MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Tegretol, Lamictal, and Glucotrol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal. The right hemisphere is relatively well organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, 30 uV.  The left hemisphere demonstrates intermittent arrhythmic delta activity seen occasionally in wakefulness, accentuated by hyperventilation, maximum in the temporal region.  There are a handful of left anterior temporal sharp waves identified in hyperventilation in the bursts of rhythmic slowing.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, the focal slowing from the left is accentuated.  On one occasion there is a train of sharp waves identified from the left temporal region, as well as a single right temporal sharp wave.  These can be differentiated from the patientâ€™s EKG artifact.   On some occasions, there is a somewhat periodic left temporal sharp wave picked up, but mixed in this discharge there will be a subtle right anterior temporal sharp wave.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The epileptiform activity appears to decrease in stage II sleep. 
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving at faster flash frequencies.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slowing.
Left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes, which are sometimes periodic.
Occasional right temporal sharp waves, which seem to occur out of the background, independently at times periodic sharp waves on the left, but occur during the same epochs when the focus on the left is active.  No seizures were recorded.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy as well as structural abnormality on the left.
