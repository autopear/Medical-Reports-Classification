MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Fentanyl, Morphine, Phenobarbital.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Low Apgar scores, abnormal behavior.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with EMG, EOG and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in quiet sleep as well as awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to an awake mixed frequency moderate to high amplitude activity which is fairly continuous and quiet sleep which displays trace altern as pattern.  There is some central as well as temporal delta brushes and some scattered temporal and central sharp waves mainly at C4, T4 and C3.
ABNORMAL FINDINGS:  There are some positive sharp waves seen at T3.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Left temporal positive sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG overall reveals normal appropriate architecture for age.  However, the positive sharp waves have a high correlation with a structural 
lesion in that region in the left temporal lobe sometimes seen with intraventricular hemorrhages.  No seizures or other epileptiform discharges were seen.
