INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient who is relatively sleepy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is moderately slow with diffuse background theta. There is occasional, subtle focal slowing from the right posterior temporal region.  There is a single left temporal sharp wave.  Stage II sleep is characterized by high amplitude vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  The spindle activity is richer in the left in comparison to the right. There is a subtle sharp wave identified in the right parietal posterior temporal region.  This can be seen in the transition to and from stage II sleep.  
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  There is a significant amount of artifact with photic on the left and there is a suggestion that the photic response is asymmetric, left greater than right; unfortunately, the artifact may accentuate this asymmetry.  
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing.
Subtle focal slowing from the right posterior temporal region. 
Asymmetric photic driving.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features identified in this record are less prominent than those seen in 1994.  Of note, the focal sharp waves are not identified in 1996.  No seizures were recorded.
