MEDICATIONS: Ativan, antibiotics, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and obtunded. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low to medium amplitude, diffusely slow. The initial portions of the record are composed primarily of 0.5 to 2 Hz delta activity.  As the recording continues, there are smaller amounts of theta and alpha frequency activity.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in amplitude of the background, as well as a small increase in faster frequency activity but alerting is not sustained. 
HR:  122 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with primarily slow, delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are non-specific and can be seen in any severe, diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  Positive prognostic features include the reactivity to external stimuli. No seizures were recorded and no epileptiform activity was seen.
