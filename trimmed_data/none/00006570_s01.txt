MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is intermittent disruption of faster frequency identified from the right hemisphere.  This is obscured partly by some head rocking artifact in the right occipital region.  Occasionally in the record, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a drop out of the alpha rhythm seen earlier on the right than the left.  
HR:  80 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent focal slowing identified from the right hemisphere characterized primarily by disruption of faster frequency activity. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Consideration for a structural or functional abnormality on the right is appropriate.  No seizures were recorded.
