	INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient appears to be awake. 	â€¢
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an interhemispheric asymmetry. The activity from the right hemisphere is somewhat slow with a posterior dominant rhythm in the range of 7 hertz. There is prominent frontal beta. The left hemisphere demonstrates rhythmic, frontal delta with sharp waves with variable maximum including left frontal or left central parietal.
	HR: 	100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to,
	1. 	Mild background slowing from the right hemisphere.
	2. 		Marked interhemispheric  asymmetry with prominent delta from the left hemisphere, particularly in the frontal region.
	3. 	Sharp waves in the left hemisphere. In the context of a breach rhythm, these are identified in the left frontal and central parietal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:    These findings are congruent with the neurosurgical history described above. The epileptiform activity in the region of this patient's hemorrhage. No seizures were recorded.
