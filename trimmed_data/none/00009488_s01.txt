MEDICATIONS: 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a disorganized pattern.  It is a dynamic pattern, with some portions that slow with a 5 to 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and generalized background theta.  There are bursts of somewhat rhythmic delta activity more prominent in the posterior region.  Occipital sharp waves are seen, sometimes maximum at O1, but sometimes at O1-O2.  Photic stimulation did not elicit a driving response.
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	Generalized background slowing.
	Intermittent occipitally predominant rhythmic delta. 
	Rare sharp waves from the occipital region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Correlation with imaging is essential as the left and right occipital regions can produce false localization on the EEG.  No seizures were recorded.
