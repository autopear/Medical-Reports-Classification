MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, ASA, Proscar, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite agitated
during the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite a great deal of muscle and motion artifact, 
the overall background includes one of rhythmic theta on the left. There seems to be 
less theta on the right with a suggestion of a some arrhythmic delta with a phase .. 
reversal a) T2/F8. As the recording continues, the patient is a little bit calmer and as he 
becomes calmer the intrahemispheric asymmetry becomes more prominent with more 
activity on the right.
of a disruption of faster 
HR: 80 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG
due to: 
1. Generalized background slowing. 
2. Superimposed attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right in comparison to 
the left. 
3. Sharply contoured delta the right . 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural functional abnormality on 
the right, as well as a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. No seizures were observed.
