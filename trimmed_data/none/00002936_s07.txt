MEDICATIONS: Celebrex, Depakote, Topiramate, many others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is anxious and has a significant amount of muscle activity in wakefulness. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the portions of the record when the patient is resting comfortably, there is a 7 Hz, 20 to 30 V posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a small amount of excess background theta.  There is also occasional focal beta or arrhythmic delta activity from the right posterior temporal region.  
Photic stimulation elicits scant or slight driving at intermediate flash frequencies. 
HR:  72 BPM with occasional bigeminy. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed subtle focal slowing from the right posterior temporal and parietal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous records, this tracing is markedly improved.  No seizures were recorded and no epileptiform features were seen.  The focal slowing is ipsilateral to this patientâ€™s previous cerebritis.
