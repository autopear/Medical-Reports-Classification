MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, antibiotics.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the neonatal nursery using standard neonatal with one channel of EKG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal for an infant of this gestational age.  This is a low voltage, markedly suppressed background with intermittent bursts of higher amplitude activity, intermittent brief bursts of beta activity, and occasional pairs of discrete bilateral sharp waves.  There is a bifrontal cuplet at 5 Hz of bifrontal sharp activity, which is picked up in the eye leads, but does not a appear to be an eye artifact.  There are also occasional focal spikes picked up in the right, occasionally maximum in the left, but with volume conduction picked up on the right.  This is a low voltage EEG in the neonatal nursery and there are problematic artifacts seen intermittently in the background.  There is also rocking artifacts or other artifacts of delta frequency.  
HR:  150 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an infant of this gestational age due to:
	Low voltage, markedly suppressed background. 
	The cerebral activity that is seen includes some low voltage beta frequency activity, but also cuplets of 5 Hz sharp waves and focal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  The Phenobarbital with a level of 19.2, would not be expected to produce this pattern.  Correlation with clinical exam and imaging is important.  No seizures were recorded.
