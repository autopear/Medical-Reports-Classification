INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a dramatic 
intrahemispheric asymmetry. While the right hemisphere is moderately slow with a theta frequency pattern and some delta, the left hemisphere demonstrates essentially continuous mixed arrhythmic theta and delta, primarily delta, with sharp waves identified in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including C3, T3 and F7. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing and an increase in beta with beta spindles on the right. The sharp waves on the left range from broadly contoured wave forms to higher amplitude spike and slow wave complexes. The patient arouses spontaneously. 
HR: 112 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent intrahemispheric asymmetry with arrhythmic delta activity on the right and disruption of faster frequency activity. 
2. Sharp waves identified in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including left central and temporal region. 
CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left which is epileptogenic in nature. No seizures were recorded.
