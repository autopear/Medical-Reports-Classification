INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the additional anterior temporal EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.   
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produced no normal discharges.     
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None. 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
