MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Phenobarbital. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation are performed. There is no log provided. There is no information provided as to whether or not this patient had seizures during the section of the record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the EEG monitoring session begins, the patient 
received 3 mg ofVersed for agitation. The initial section s of the record demonstrate low voltage beta pattern. As he recording continues, the patient Is increasingly agitated, sitting up, moving about. The seizures detected are mostly muscle or agitation. This is a technically challenging record due to the patient's movement. Reformatting the data does not particularly help in terms of Interpreting the background. The Interpretable sections of the record demonstrate a slow pattern with beta, head rocking artifact. 
HR: 116 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Pattern of background delta and beta. 
2. FIRDA. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded, however, epileptiform activity may 
have been overlooked in the later sections of the record due to electrode artifact. There is a suggestion particularly at 10:20 p.m. with sharp waves in the right anterior temporal region. Occasional broadly contoured right anterior temporal sharp waves can be identified at 10:20 p.m. but additional epileptiform activity may have been under recognized due to the patients agitation.
