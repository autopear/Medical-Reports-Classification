INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There is only one practice push button. In the first 24 hours of the recording, there are no seizures recognized by the computer or the technologist.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG includes a symmetric, reactive well-formed posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz, 20 uV, with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Stage II sleep is characterized by abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Sleep is overall disrupted.
