MEDICATIONS: see baseline
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside.  There is only one practice push button.  No seizures were recorded by the patient, the computer, or the nursing staff. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates intermittent, rhythmic theta from the left hemisphere.  There are rare, left temporal sharp waves seen in wakefulness and a single right temporal sharp wave.  The vast majority of the epileptiform activity is in stage I or stage II sleep with focal slowing from the left temporal region and occasional sharp waves. 
HR:  84 BPM.
