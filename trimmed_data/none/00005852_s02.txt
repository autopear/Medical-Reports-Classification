MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl, Versed, Ativan, many others
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a patient with eye movement compatible with wakefulness and occasional spontaneous movements.  The background EEG is abnormal, absent in alpha rhythm with lower voltage, somewhat attenuated pattern and occasional theta and/or delta frequency activity.  There are occasional periodic complexes identified in either frontal region, as well as occasional left frontocentral sharp waves. 
Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle in the background.  Stimulation of the patient also seems to decrease the periodic activity in the sharp waves.
HR:  90 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Left frontocentral sharp waves.
Rare shifting periodic complexes in either frontal region.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This tracing supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter.  Consideration for a structural, CNS process would be appropriate.
