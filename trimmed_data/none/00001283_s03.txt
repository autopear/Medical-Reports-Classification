MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and 
very sweaty. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a technically challenging EEG due to 
muscle and ventilator artifact. There is certainly some low voltage cerebral activity in 
the theta and delta range, as well as artifacts. There are artifactual bursts of frontal 
delta compatible with the patient's ventilator. Stimulation of the patient does not clearly 
activate the record. 
HR: 120bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Significant background slowing. 
CLINICAL There are no focal nor epileptiform features. This is a 
markedly slow background compatible with a severe disturbance of cerebral function as 
might be anticipated after a cardiac arrest or in the context of sepsis. If this patient's 
mental status fails to improve, a follow up EEG may be of use. There were no seizures 
and no epileptiform features noted.
