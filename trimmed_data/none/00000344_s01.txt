MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Amlodipine, and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   RECORD:  The  background  EEG  is  disorganized  and medium-to-high an1plitude. There is a discernable posterior dominant rhythm of 6 to 8
		Hz.  Despite movement and other artifacts, there is intermittent  arrhythmic delta activity seen  in the frontal regions, sometimes left greater than 1ight, with an underlying left frontal sharp and slow wave complex.  Despite the movement artifact, there is also some rhythmic  3 Hz  activity picked up from the left frontotemporal region. 	Features  of   	 drowsiness include an increase in  background  beta·and occasional vertex waves.  Some
of the vertex waves are asymmetric, maximum on the 1ight.  Occasional POSTS are seen as the patient drifts off to sleep, but sleep is not sustained.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
2.   FIRDA.
3.   Occasional left frontal delta with spike and slow wave complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  The left frontal delta with spike and slow wave complexes  is in the region of this patient's hemorrhage.   The FIRDA is a non­ specific finding and may be seen in this clinical context.  No seizures were recorded.
