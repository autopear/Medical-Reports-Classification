MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Famotidine, Enoxaparin, Lovenox.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  Both wakefulness and obtundation was recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Diffuse movement artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background in the delta theta frequencies with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No sleep is recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.  Stimulation is performed which reveals increased muscle artifact in the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  General slow waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
