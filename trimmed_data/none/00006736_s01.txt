MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Patient is drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized. There are portions of the record where the patient is speaking and an alpha rhythm is apparent bilaterally which is approximately 8 Hz. lntrahemispheric asymmetry is observed with more arrhythmic delta activity on the left than the right and some sharply contoured activity in the left mid temporal region.
Heart rate 96 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Intrahemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity particularly left frontotemporal region as well as left frontotemporal delta.
	2.	Occasional sharp waves in the left hemisphere.
	3.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded. This patient was conversant albeit slowly. Her language pattern was not ictal.
