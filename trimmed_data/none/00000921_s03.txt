MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Protonix, Zocor 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation. There is no photic stimulation. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes some sections with a well-defined, rhythmic, 7 Hz alpha rhythm. This pattern is disrupted by bursts of bihemispheric arrhythmic delta. In the transition to sleep, POSTS are observed but they are higher amplitude on the right when compared to the left. In sleep, there are bursts of shifting slowing and right occipital temporal focal delta is noted. During other sections of the record, there is a bit more rhythmic delta noted in the left hemisphere and in this bedside portal record, unfortunately, there is also some head-rocking artifact. 
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Generalized slowing. 
2. Bursts of paroxysmal irregular bihemispheric delta. 
3. Shifting delta but, at times, right occipital temporal delta is noted. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with this patient's neuroimaging. The paroxysmal slowing may be seen as part of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which can be part of bilateral ischemic white matter pathology or due to another diffuse disturbance of cerebral function such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded. The overall background slowing may be reflected in this patient's slowed mentation.
