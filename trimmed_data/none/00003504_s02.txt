INTRODUCTION: 
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG There are significant technical issues with this EEG. The system believes that the EEG is still being recorded. There is a great deal of electrode artifact seen in the reviewed EEG, but not in the initial study This was resolved 7/18 and study was reviewed again. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
There is a profoundly abnormal background. There is a slow background w1th continuous typhasic waves with an anterior to posterior lag superimposed upon a featureless background. There are also intermittent sharp waves from either hemisphere and occasional periodic discharges 
Stimulation of the patient seems to produce an increase in the activity. 
Heart rate greater than 100 BPM. 
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
The triphasic waves supports a diffuse process, metabolic process but the periodic sharp waves suggest an irritable cortex and a potential for seizures. No seizures were recorded.
