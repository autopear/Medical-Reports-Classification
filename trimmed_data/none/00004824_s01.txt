INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at beds(de using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no documentation that 
Seizure medications were given, nor that clinical events which suggested seizures were 
recorded. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very suppressed 
pattern with an intrahemisphefic asymmetry. The activity on the right is low voltage delta and 
featureless. On the left there is a bit more faster frequency activity and occasional left frontal 
temporal sharp waves. Some sections of the record, particularly later sections of the record, 
when the patient was placed on a cooling blanket, demonstrate loss of integrity of the record. 
This· study runs from January 10,2009 to January12,2009 at 0905. Due to the poor quality of 
the· EEG data, any valuable data would be lost by1900 hours on January 11,2009. 
HR: 60-90 bpm 
Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. . . 
2. An intrahemispheric asymmetry, compatible with a previous craniotomy characterized by 
relative suppression of faster frequency activity on the right and occasional sharp waves on 
the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded in any part of this long term 
monitoring, including a section that followed on the morning of January 12 , 2009, however, 
there are technical Issues in regards to overall quality.
