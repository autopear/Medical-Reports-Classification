MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG includes a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm, identified bilaterally. Lambda activity is observed. Rare left temporal sharp waves are observed in quiet wakefulness. They are well defined and discrete. Hyperventilation is performed, early on in the record, producing hypersynchronous high amplitude posteriorly predominant 3-5 hertz activity. Features of drowsiness  include slowing of the background. As the child becomes drowsy, vertex waves are observed bilaterally. The left temporal spikes seem to transition to a mid-temporal localization with
posterior temporal spread. Others in similar sleep state and same montages  are anterior temporal. In this transition in and out of sleep, there is almost a normal variant with a 5 hertz activity, but again some of the epileptiform activity transitions to a broader field of spread and in the cluster of sharp waves, some are mid-posterior  temporal and others more frontotemporal. In the drowsy record,  there are some bursts in the left central temporal region with a generous field of spread.
Photic stimulation does not active the record.
	HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG for a child of this age, due to:
1.   Sharp waves in the left hemisphere  which may be anterior temporal, frontotemporal or central temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The variability of the sharp waves would be unusual for one of the more benign epilepsies. Therefore, correlation with imaging and clinical history is advised.  No seizures were recorded.
