INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with one additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep stage 1.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.   
Abnormal discharges: None. 
Heart rate: 78.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
