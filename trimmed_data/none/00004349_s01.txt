REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lovenox, enoxaparin, and vitamin B12.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz.  The patient has normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient easily drowses off into sleep and goes into stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Occasional focal slowing seen at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.   
Heart rate 80.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
