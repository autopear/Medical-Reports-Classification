MEDICATIONS:  Levothyroxine, Loratadine, Metoprolol, Aspirin, Benadryl, Epinephrine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient reaches stage I sleep.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F8/T4 and less frequently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 mV.   
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. dependent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
