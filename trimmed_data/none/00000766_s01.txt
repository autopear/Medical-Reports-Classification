MEDICATIONS: Solu-Medrol, Zosyn, Insulin, Cardizem 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with rhythmic 4 hertz and a smaller amount of faster frequency activity. The activity is overall relatively low voltage and if anything is somewhat suppressed in the left frontal central or frontotemporal regions. Stimulation of the patient produces minimal activation of the record. There is some more vertex like activity in the vertex. Spontaneous eye movements are observed. 
HR: 125 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Replacement of normal background with a lower voltage slower pattern. 
2. Superimposed attenuation of activity on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are relatively subtle in comparison to the imaging findings. No seizures or focal sharp waves were observed.
