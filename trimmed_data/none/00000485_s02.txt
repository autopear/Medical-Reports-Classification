MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Ativan, and insulin.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  In this 24-hour section, no seizures were reported.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage but dynamic pattern.  The initial portions of the record are low voltage, slow, with primarily frontal theta frequency activity.  There is clear variability in the record and there are some portions of the record, particularly when the patient is stimulated, when there is more theta frequency activity.  Other sections of the record including sections when the patient is actually stimulated, demonstrate essentially a burst suppression pattern with some asymmetry with more faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.  The burst suppression pattern is more prominent in the evening hours and into the morning, and the burst suppression seems to be less prominent towards the close of the epoch and the early morning hours, particularly after 8:00 AM. 
HR:  72 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: This section of the 24-hour EEG recording is compatible with a pharmacologic coma, as would be anticipated with the use of high dose Phenobarbital.  No other clinical information is available at this time.  
	
	OVERALL IMPRESSION: This 48-hour (10/18-20/06) EEG monitoring in the ICU did not identify subclinical seizures or epileptiform activity, however, the background was abnormal compatible with a severe intracerebral hemorrhage and the use of barbiturate coma.
