INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is intubated and poorly responsive. 
The EEG is performed more than 24 hours after the cardiac arrest. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and featureless. 
There is scant eye movement. In addition, there is a slow periodic discharge which 
appears approximately every 5 seconds. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the 
record particularly, but that very slow periodic discharge is more of a left posterior 
localization. 
HR: 90 bpm and irregular 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Marked background slowing. 
2. An asymmetry with a little bit more theta on the left and a very slow, broad periodic 
complex out of the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are hallmarks of a severe underlying 
encephalopathy as can be seen following anoxia. No seizures were seen, and there are 
no specific epileptiform findings.
