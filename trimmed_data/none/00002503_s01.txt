MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is bedside.  He is described as lethargic. The background EEG is low voltage and relatively featureless.  There is slow delta.  There are intermittent bursts of low voltage theta activity.  There is an occasional right occipital sharp and slow wave complex.  
Stimulation of the patient does not clearly activate the record.  
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing with an overall low voltage, suppressed pattern.
Right occipital, intermittent, periodic sharp waves, occasionally with as many as five sharp waves within a ten second period but no actual evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a severe, diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter.  The right occipital sharp waves have been identified in the past. No seizures were recorded in this study.
