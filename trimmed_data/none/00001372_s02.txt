MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Depakote, multiple immunosuppressants, and steroids. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of 
EKG. The patient is quite somnolent. She had Ativan 6 hours prior to the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is quite somnolent the overall background EEG Is quite slow and suppressed. There are some shifting asymmetries. Spindles are noted. The activity is lower voltage on the right and a bit duller and more featureless on the left. Intermittent bursts of beta are noted. Spontaneous arousals are characterized by the appearance of theta with the patient moving her hands with some tremulous hand movement and looking to the left. After this, she seems to drift off to sleep. 
HR: 90 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due 10 
1. Marked background slowing
2. All asymmetry with a somewhat more featureless pattern on the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Overall, this EEG is supporting bihemispheric, significant disturbance of cerebral function. No seizures were recorded and there were no epileptiform features
