INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient Is Intubated and poorly responsive.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow, featureless 
pattern. There is periodic sharp activity noted in the right hemisphere, particularly T6-T4, almost with a positivity posteriorly. The periodic sharp activity is variable in terms of Hs amplitude, as well as its field of spread, and sometimes is more clearly T6-T4. There is a small, almost artifactual looking, spike picked up at F7-T3 in the region of the craniotomy defects, which Is independent of the periodic complex on the right which is seen approximately 4 times a 10 second period. Stimulation of the patient produces a bit of theta.  
HR: 96bpm  
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Periodic sharp activity or sharply contoured delta from the right mid to posterior quadrant. 
2. A tiny spike from the left.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to the previous studies Identified earlier this month. No seizures were recorded. The presence of a reactive pattern Is a positive prognostic finding.
