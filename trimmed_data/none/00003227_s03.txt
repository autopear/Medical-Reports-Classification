MEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Lamotrigine. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: No seizures were reported by the patient in this section of the record.  
Long-Term EEG Monitoring, October 14, 2006 to October 15, 2006
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD During this section of the record, no seizures were reported. Medications were reinitiated in preparation of discharge.  Even when there is artifact in the background, right temporal spike and slow wave complexes and focal slowing are noted in wakefulness into stage II sleep.  Interestingly, there is more epileptiform activity on the right in comparison to some of the other days, and they are typically high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes in wakefulness and drowsiness with less frequent but independent spikes seen from the left temporal region.  Fortunately, by the morning of the 15th, the epileptiform activity has decreased in wakefulness.  
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to:
	Independent, right greater than left temporal spike and slow wave activity with higher amplitude and even at times multiphasic epileptiform activity from the right with more typically simple epileptiform activity from the left. 
	A complex partial seizure was recorded with inadequate scalp localization, but at least the scalp EEG itself suggests that the seizure emanated from the left rather than the right, although given the patientâ€™s position in the bed, the behavior was not clearly lateralizing. 
	
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  These findings are similar to previous reports of inadequate scalp localization by EEG for potential resective epilepsy surgery.
