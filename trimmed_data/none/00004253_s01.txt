MEDICATIONS: Insulin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. No clinical or electrographic seizures are identified.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is described as unresponsive.  There is no indication that the patient is intubated or if there are other features in the ICU.  The initial EEG is low voltage with a mixture of delta and theta activity.  In the initial portions of the recording, there is a suggestion of slower, lower voltage delta.  While there are no clinical events, there are portions of the record when the patient is moving with eye opening.  This is seen by 18:22.  There is additional motor activity seen at 1:45 AM.  There is variability in the last eight hours of the recording with some portions of the record showing more theta and delta, as well as more higher amplitude activity.  The subtle asymmetry is identifiable throughout the final eight hours of the recording with what sometimes is higher amplitude slower delta and at other times, the right side appears to be lower in amplitude.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Interhemispheric asymmetry seen intermittently throughout the record with slower activity on the right.
Generalized background slowing, with some evidence of improvement at the end of the  record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function, potentially effecting the right hemisphere more than the left.  For individuals in the ICU in this state, stimulation of the patient, particularly at the close of the record, can be valuable.
