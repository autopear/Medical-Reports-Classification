INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
electrode placement, 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a diffusely rhythmically slow background 
with a breech rhythm, seen more rhythm in mid regions. There is more beta activity 
seen from the last. The slow background is about 2 to 5Hz reaching about 15 micro 
volts at times. There is an asymmetry with at times some left focal slowing and sharp 
waves seen in the mid temporal regions. There are no recorded. 
seizures in the record. 
Photic stimulation does not activate the record. 
HR: 84 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Extensive slowing of background. 
2. · Left focal slowing. . 
3. Some left anterior sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no seizures in this record · but there are left 
a11terior temporal sharp waves: seen at times which is consistent with a focus for seizure 
activity. As well the slowing ·of the background is consistent with a bihemispheric 
disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.
