MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Neurontin, Digoxin, and Percocet. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized with prominent disruption of faster frequency activity.  There is arrhythmic delta activity and occasional triphasic waves are noted.  Shifting asymmetries are seen.  Stimulation of the patient does produce an increase in faster frequency activity.   
HR:  120 BPM, irregular.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The features described above are non-specific, but are compatible with a toxic or metabolic process and/or underlying bihemispheric process involving both gray and white matter.
