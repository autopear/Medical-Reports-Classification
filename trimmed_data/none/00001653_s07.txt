MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenytoin, VNS. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Early drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8 Hz.   Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
There is a single abnormality identified in this record in the transition just as the patient is drifting off to sleep and it does seem to elicit an arousal.  This is a frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex with a poly spike and slow wave component reaching amplitudes up to 200 uV.  It is symmetric and frontally predominant.  The whole entire entity includes a burst of approximately one second without clear correlate, but with an alerting.  
HR:  84 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	An isolated, frontally predominant spike and slow wave complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous studies, this EEG demonstrated a relative paucity of epileptiform activity.  This may be due to the little sleep that was recorded in this record.  Of note, this patient has a history of prominent spike and slow wave activity in sleep.  The observation of an arousal in association with epileptiform activity may be part of this patientâ€™s underlying sleep disturbance.
