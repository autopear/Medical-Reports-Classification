MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, phenobarbital, Acyclovir and morphine, Ativan. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the Neonatal nursing using
standard neonatal montage with one channel of EKG.  This is a 1 hour EEG. The patient is described as lethargic. This is a 29 week gestation infant now at 8 weeks of age, hence approximately  37 weeks total.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is lower voltage more featureless with occasional sharp waves identified independently in the right or left temporal or central region. In the video, it can be overheard that the child had had seizures although it is not possible to know exactly when. There is some variability. Some sections of the record are richer in mixed frequency activity, but other return to a
	----Â·	lower voltage more featureless pattern. Tactile stimulation activities the record
producing a medium amplitude mixed theta delta pattern. Following the tactile stimulation, there is more of a medium amplitude mixed frequency pattern.
There are no epochs of active sleep or delta observed today. Heart rate 150 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Occasional sharp waves identified from the left or right hemisphere in the temporal or central regions.
	2. 	Compared to last week, a lower voltage more featureless background which did seem to improve with tactile stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were observed. From that perspective, this represents an improvement,  but the lower voltage pattern raises concerns about a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which may include a ictal or sedated pattern. Clinical correlation is advised.
