MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, Zyrtec, Synthroid, Statin.
REASON FOR STUDY:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was only recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low voltage recording with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  No sleep is seen.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None. 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
