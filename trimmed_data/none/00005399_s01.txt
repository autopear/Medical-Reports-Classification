INTRODUCTION: 
Routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode. The patient was awake and asleep during the recording. Hyperventilation was not performed and photic stimulation was performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Hydralazine and albuterol 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
None 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The study opens to a well-formed 9 Hz to 10 Hz with 20 to 70 microvolts amplitude, posterior dominant rhythm, that is symmetrically reactive to eye opening. There is normal frontal-central beta activity with 15 Hz to 25 Hz and 13 to 15 microvolts amplitude. Sleep is characterized by stage I. Hyperventilation was not performed and photic stimulation was 
normal. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE: 
None. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Normal EEG, awake and sleep. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG is normal. Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
