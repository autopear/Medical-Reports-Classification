REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures and episode of hypoglycemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, insulin, Dilantin, Percocet, Lovenox, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode  placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which was reactive to eye opening.  There was an excess amount of beta throughout the recording.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, produced no abnormal discharges. 
Abnormal discharges:  None. 
Heart rate:  96.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The excessive beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect seen with barbiturates or benzodiazepines.
