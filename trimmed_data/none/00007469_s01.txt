MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Morphine. Famotidine. Lopressor 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
 The background EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency 
background. There are intermittent high amplitude sharp waves from the right hemisphere, 
maximum in the frontal regions but with a generous field of spread throughout the right 
hemisphere. There are also occasional bursts of rhythmic slowing noted in the right 
frontocentral region. The additional background includes at times a mixture of alpha and beta 
frequency activity on the left. From the right hemisphere. the faster frequency activity is 
disrupted and there is more of a pattern of theta delta. Stimulation of the patient clearly 
produces an arousal with faster frequency activity Identified bilaterally. Although there are some 
sections of the record with bursts of sharp waves or trains or sharp waves, there are no 
sustained ictal discharges. Features of drowsiness include a prominent increase in beta 
identified bilaterally although less so on the right frontocentral region. 
HR: 84bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. High amplitude sharp waves from the right hemisphere particularly frontocentral regions 
with a generous field of spread. 
2. Intermittent rhythmic delta from the right central region. 
3. Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right. 
CLINICAL There were no seizures identified Supports a focal mechanism for 
seizures.
