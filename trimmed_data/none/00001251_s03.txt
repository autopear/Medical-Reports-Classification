MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Wellbutrin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude posterior dominant rhythm best seen over the right hemisphere with a frequency of 9-10 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 mV.  At times it can be seen over the left hemisphere, but not as frequently.  There is also an excess amount of frontal central beta seen diffusely.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None. 
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
