MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Ativan. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient receives an infusion of Dilantin during the EEG. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the background EEG is medium amplitude with a mixture of delta and theta.  Early on in the record, as the Dilantin is infusing, there are portions of the record with continuous, sharply contoured delta identified from the left mid-temporal region.  There are occasional associated sharp waves seen in this background with variable phase reversals, T3, F7.  Unfortunately, there is also some single channel artifact picked up as well, but there is an overall field for the focal slowing.  As the recording continues and the background muscle drops out, a high amplitude F7 sharp and slow wave complex is identified. At 13:37:50, there is a dramatic change in terms of the presence of a posterior dominant rhythm seen with stimulation.  The posterior dominant rhythm is identifiable bilaterally, right perhaps better than the left, approximately 9 Hz, 30 V and the left frontotemporal focal slowing persists, but the periodic nature has resolved and there are no additional sharp waves. 
HR:  78 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Initially periodic slowing identified from the left temporal region with a large field of spread.
Left frontotemporal focal slowing by the close of the record. 
Left frontotemporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is less remarkable than the previous study.  In contrast to a previous study, this record demonstrates epileptiform activity, but a breach rhythm is not so remarkable.  
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This tracing is compatible with an acute epileptic process with dramatic improvement, consistent with the infusion of medication as well as cessation of the seizures.
