INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were 
performed. The patient has marked deformities of her skull. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a 
breach rhythm identified in the right hemisphere with the patient's craniotomies. There is some 
phasing reversing artifact, but there is also some underlying arrhythmic delta activity in the right 
hemisphere. As the patient becomes drowsy, the breach rhythm is associated with an 
accentuation of spindle activity in stage II sleep in the right frontocentral region. There are rare 
right anterior temporal sharp waves identified in the record despite the artifacts described 
above. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Right hemispheric, primarily temporal focal slowing. 
2. Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality, most significant on 
the right. The anterior temporal sharp waves are perhaps out of the anticipated localization for 
an individual with hemisensory seizures. No seizures were recorded.
