MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Isoflurine, Midazalam, Propofol, Fentanyl, and Dilantin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is described as sedated.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During much of the record, the patient is asleep.  There is generous background beta.  In stage II sleep, vertex waves, spindles, and occasional POSTS are seen.  There are rare bursts of delta, slightly higher from the left temporal region than the right.  Stimulation of the patient produces a brief arousal with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm of 20 uV. 
HR:  60 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Slightly higher amplitude delta from the left. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are compatible with pharmacologic sedation with an increase in background beta, both in brief wakefulness through stage II sleep and pathological drowsiness.  No seizures or epileptiform features were seen.  If further localization of this individualâ€™s epilepsy is important, a repeat study is recommended.
