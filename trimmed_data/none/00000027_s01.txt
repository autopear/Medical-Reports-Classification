MEDICATIONS: Protonix, Labetalol, Megace. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as very 
confused and unable to follow commands. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is markedly abnormal. It 
includes a mixture of rhythmic, 6 Hz theta, and rhythmic frontal delta. There are bursts 
of notched, frontal delta. As the patient becomes drowsy, additional bursts of high 
amplitude frontal slow paroxysmal delta are observed. The patient spontaneously 
arouses with an increase in faster frequency activity. Photic stimulation does not 
activate the record. 
HR: 96bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Prominent bursts of paroxysmal FIRDA. 
2. Generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. The findings described are 
hallmarks of metabolic encephalopathy, although the same pattern can be seen in CNS 
disturbances due to other causes. A follow up study after this patients mental status 
improves may be of value.
