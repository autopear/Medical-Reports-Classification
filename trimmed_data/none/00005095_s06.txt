INTRODUCTION:  Digital-video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel EKG.  Prior long term monitoring studies.
	DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the start of this epoch, a largely attenuated record is seen.  Burst Suppression with suppression lasting for 2-6 seconds with intermittent right P4 spike waves seen with a large field of spread.  These spike waves will be 60-65 microV.  At times, the more suppressed record shows a bit of frontal theta. Heart rate 70 beats per minute and irregular. 	Â·
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Attenuated background.
	2. 	Right P4 spike waves.
	3.	Burst Superposition pattern
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures are seen on this record.  The attenuated background is consistent with medication. The right epileptiform activity is continuous discharge from that area.
