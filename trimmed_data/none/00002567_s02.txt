REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ambien, Tessalon, lisinopril, metoprolol, diltiazem, warfarin, pravastatin, fluoxetine, pantoprazole.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Occasional left mid temporal slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66 and irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to occasional left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
