MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Morphine, Labetalol and Norvasc. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic 
stimulation were not performed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely 
slow with low amplitude. There had been intermittent rhythmic theta and delta with 
bursts of delta activity. Also right frontal sharps and right frontalbreach rhythm has been 
recorded. Abnormal eye movements were recorded also. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Diffusely slowing background. 
2. Right frontal sharps and right frontal breach rhythm. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded or identified on this record. 
The right frontal breach and sharp waves seen in the prior ventriculostomy placement 
and these are nonspecific and support the disturbance of abnormal brain activity.
