MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Carafate, aspirin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and is described as having eye blinking. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, is comprised of mixed frequency activity with arrhythmic delta activity, rich with superimposed 4 to5 Hz activity and some 7 to 9 Hz activity.  There is intermittent, attenuation in the occipital scalp regions bilaterally.  The patient has eye blinking, although stimulation during this record is limited to assess responsiveness.   Stimulation of the patient doesnâ€™t significantly activate the record.  There is a modest amount of background variability. 
HR:  120 BPM, irregular. 
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing with occasional arrhythmic delta from the posterior regions. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The continuous pattern following cardiac rest is, generally speaking, a more positive prognostic factor in terms of survival, although stimulation of this individual was somewhat limited.  This tracing does, however, support a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter.  Clinical contributors for this pattern can include anoxic injury, toxic or metabolic processes, as well as an underlying chronic disturbances of brain function such as white matter disease or dementing illnesses. No epileptiform features were identified in this record and no seizures were recorded.  If additional evaluation is needed, a follow-up study as the patient's medical condition stabilizes could be helpful.
