INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The nurses and patient report no seizures.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal, sharply contoured with higher amplitude delta identified from the right hemisphere.  A breach rhythm is identified from the right.  Despite the areas of encephalomalacia, there is an increase in fast activity and occasional right frontocentral sharp waves seen in the record.  The computer is reviewed, and there are no electrographic seizures identified.  There is rhythmic, higher amplitude theta frequency activity in the right frontocentral regions, as well as sharp waves seen in that region.  There are occasional to infrequent sharp waves at T5/O1, as well as rare sharp waves in the left anterior temporal region.  The patient is awake throughout much of the night with primarily a rhythmic beta frequency background and superimposed arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere.
