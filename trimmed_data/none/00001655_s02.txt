REASON FOR STUDY:  Differential and classification of seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote, Topamax and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record appears to have a low amplitude posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is excessive beta seen throughout the recording.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
