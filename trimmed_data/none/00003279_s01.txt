MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The pattern is very high amplitude, chaotically organized, and lacking in the normal developmental milestones.  The child is awake, sucking on a bottle.  At this time, the primary frequencies are delta with smaller amounts of theta.  There is variability in the record and multiple different types of epileptiform activities are seen including high amplitude 2 Hz spike and slow wave activity as well as focal epileptiform activity including the right temporal region and left parietal.  There is some poly spike or fast activity seen in the left frontal region, as well as some sharp waves in the left posterior temporal region.  There are shifting asymmetries.  As the recording continues, the child is awake and agitated.  At this time, the slow spike and wave as well as the occasional focal spike and slow wave activity is seen.  At times, there is slow spike and wave activity identified focally including the right temporal region.  
Photic stimulation does not significantly affect the tracing.
HR:  Uninterpretable.  
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Absence of the normal developmental milestones for an infant of this age.
Slow spike and wave activity.
Multifocal spike and slow wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  No electrodecrimental response was seen.  This EEG supports a severe, early developmental disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter and raises the possibility of seizures.
