TOTAL LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Approximately 21 hours.
MEDICATIONS:  Include Dilantin, antibiotics and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Nursing notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic primarily delta activity admixed with rare theta and under-riding faster frequencies.  During sleep, there is further slowing of the background with predominance of delta activity observed and occasional diffuse background discontinuities.  There is evidence of reactivity on the EEG during stimulation, characterized by increase in background frequencies.  No clear electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges were captured.
FINDINGS:  
* Moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing.
* No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal continuous 21-hour video EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No electrographic seizures were captured. These findings were conveyed to the neurology consultation team at the time of the review.
