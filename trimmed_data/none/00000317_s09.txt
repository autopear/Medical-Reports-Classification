MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote, Phenergan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrent seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG for 75 hours was performed at bedside using 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior, temporal, and EKG electrodes.  Continuous seizure detection software as well as spike detection software were utilized and supplemented by patient activated alarm, nursing observation and testing.  The video EEG files were reviewed on a daily basis.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, which is seen symmetrically at 20 to 60 microvolt amplitude, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were seen.   
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
There were focal sharp waves seen in the F7/T3 region at times in runs.  
Focal sharp waves seen infrequently at F8/T2.
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves. 
Seizure and spike detector review and patient push-button events:  All the patient events, as well as the spike detention events, revealed no abnormal epileptiform discharges.  The patient did not actually purposely push the button on any occasion for an actual event that she felt and the nurses did not note any seizures.  No seizures were also seen during the recording of the EEG.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
left anterior temporal frequent sharp waves with rare right anterior temporal sharp waves. 
Independent bitemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from either anterior temporal lobe.  There is additional evidence of independent bilateral temporal dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures were recorded in this long-term monitoring of 75 hours.
