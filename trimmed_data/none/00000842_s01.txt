INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somewhat 
drowsy. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly 
slow background with rhythmic theta and delta, more of a delta than theta pattern. 
There are frontally predominantly triphasic waves. There are also some bifrontal 
generalized periodic sharps, only isolated, not evolving, and some right frontal sharp 
waves. Stimulation of the patient produces a brief alerting response with an increase in 
theta. 
HR: 96 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
I. Prominent triphasic waves. 
2. Marked background slowing. 
3. Occasional right frontal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. These findings are more 
compatible with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
