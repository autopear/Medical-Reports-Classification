REASON FOR STUDY:  Dizziness and passing out.
STAGES:  Awake and drowsy.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  Photic stimulation was performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Lexapro, pioglitazone.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  There was a T3 electrode dislodgement artifact which was fixed.
INTRODUCTION:  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz alpha at 9 to 10 Hz frequency and 30 to 50 microvolts in amplitude.  The posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a good anteroposterior gradient with normal beta. 
Sleep:  The patient achieved drowsiness during the record which was characterized by anterior spread of alpha and occasional vertex spikes. 
There was 1 asymmetry vertex wave seen on the left hemisphere. 
Hyperventilation was not performed. 
Photic stimulation was performed which produced no abnormal discharges. 
Abnormal discharges:  None. 
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This a normal EEG. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
