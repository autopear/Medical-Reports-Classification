MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Zonisamide, Paxil, Dilantin, others. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent with non-sensical speech. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow.  There is shifting asymmetries and some portions of the record demonstrate relative suppression on the right compared to the left. The overall background is one of theta frequency activity with occasional delta and occasional faster frequency activity.  There is no well-defined posterior dominant rhythm in apparent wakefulness.  There is a discrete sharp and slow complex identified in the left central parietal region, seen particularly in drowsiness.  
HR:  96 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Intermittent suppression from the right.
Left central parietal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter, which may include toxic and/or metabolic encephalopathy or postictal state.  A partial mechanism for epilepsy can be considered.  Correlation with imaging is recommended.
