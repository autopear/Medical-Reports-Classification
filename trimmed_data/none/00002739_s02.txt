MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 
.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement With 路1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation and 
hyperventilation performed. 路 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECO..D:-During wakefulness .re is somewhat 
.disorganized background, with a posterior dominant alpha rhy1hm of 9.5 Hz. The 
background also seen excess theta. On the left hemisphere, frontocentral and 
frontotemporal sharp waves are seen. occasionally, on the right, midtemporal sharp 
waves are also seen at T4. especially during sleep路. During photic stimulation, the路 
patient is seen falling asleep. Drowsiness is seen with slowing of the background 
spikey vertex waves and K-complexes as she enters deeper sleep. During hyperventilation there is no activation of the record. 
HR: 78bpm 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Somewhat disorganized background with some excess theta. 
2. Left greater than right sharp waves. Left side frontocentral frontotemporal field 
while right side temporal in nature. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Comparative to previous 'EEG, the record shows fewer 
epileptiform discharges. The overall background is similar to the 2006 study. There 
remains bilateral focuses for seizure disorder in the record. No seizures were recorded.
