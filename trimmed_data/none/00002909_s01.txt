MEDICATIONS: Gentamicin, atropine. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and 
poorly responsive. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, slow and 
disorganized with a mixed frequency pattern. There was significant muscle activity on 
the right. Both hemispheres include generous theta and delta with a handful of left 
posterior temporal sharp waves. 
Heart rate: 60-90 BMP. 
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Slow and disorganized background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The muscle activity precludes adequate evaluation on the 
right, but this EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance as may be seen in the context 
of an intracerebral hemorrhage. There ware a handful of sharp waves, but no seizures.
