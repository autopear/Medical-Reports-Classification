REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, albuterol, Advair.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is recorded mainly in sleep.  Activity includes photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record is mainly while asleep, but while awake, the posterior dominant rhythm appears to reach 9 Hz.  There is excessive beta seen throughout the recording.  Activity and procedures include photic stimulation with non-normal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T4, much more frequently than at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts. 
Heart Rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals a focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal regions (right more than left), which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The excessive beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.
