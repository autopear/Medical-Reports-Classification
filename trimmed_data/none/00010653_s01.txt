TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I, and stage II sleep. 
Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges. 
Abnormal discharges:  None.
