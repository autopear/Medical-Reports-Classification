MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Depakote, carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is awake and somewhat cooperative.   Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG includes a pattern of rhythmic background theta interrupted by bursts of arrhythmic delta activity which may be seen in either hemisphere. There are occasional high amplitude right mid temporal sharp waves or sharply contoured delta. At the close of the record, the patient abruptly ended the test, but he did complete the EEG.
HR:   80 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Background slowing and disorganization.
	2. 	Right temporal sharp waves and sharply contoured slowing.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
This background is slower than the 2005 study. It supports
a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, such as can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. No seizures were recorded.
