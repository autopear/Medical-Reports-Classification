MEDICATIONS: Zantac, Feosol, Sorbitol, lmdur, Colace, Risperdal, and Actonel.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed  in the  lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.   This is an awake record with the patient sitting in a wheelchair.
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  RECORD:   In  wakefulness, the  background EEG is continuous,  symmetric,  poorly  organized,  and  diffusely  slow.    The  normal  posterior dominant alpha rhythm is absent, however, 4 to 5 Hz, 30 uV activity is identified.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Rare left frontal and central sharply contoured activity is observed.  No sleeping stages were achieved in this tracing.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Poorly organized and diffusely slow background.
2.  Rare left frontal and central sharply contoured activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is non-specific and can be seen in patients with  dementia,  toxic  or metabolic encephalopathy,  or  postictal phase.    However,  no seizures were recorded in this tracing. If epilepsy is a clinical concern,  a repeat EEG
Capturing deeper stages of sleep  may be helpful.
