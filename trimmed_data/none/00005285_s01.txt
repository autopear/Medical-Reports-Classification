INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG demonstrates background disorganization. There is also an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The right hemisphere includes activity of 7.5 to 8.5 Hz.  Its organization is somewhat better than the left.  The left hemisphere demonstrates  disruption of faster frequency activity and more lower voltage, mixed theta and delta.  There are also left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves observed.  Features of drowsiness included increase in rhythmicity of the background.   Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep.
HR:   60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
	1. 	Generalized background slowing.
	2. 	Arrhythmic delta activity in the left temporal region.
	3.	Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left involving gray and white matter.  No seizures were recorded.
