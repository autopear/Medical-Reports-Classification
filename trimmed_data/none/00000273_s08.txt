INTRODUCTION: Digitalvideo EEG wasÂ·performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channelEKG. The pallentis awake but somnolent.
DESCRI PTI ON OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern but an awake pattern from the right hemisphere. Theleft hemisphere demonstrates significant disruption of faster frequency activity, part cularly from theleft frontalcentral regions. Pooy formed,periodic sharp waves,are seen in the left hemisphere with stable maximum,including   left frontalandleft frontoparielal. Patient also has some bursts of fast activity which can accompany the sharp waves on theleft.She is observed to have someinvoluntary movements of her head during the EEG which are not associated with a change in the epileptiform activity.
HR:   120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Poorly formed.period.ic sharpwavesin theleft hemisphere with variable maximum.
Focalslowing with disruption of faster frequency activity, particularly left frontalregions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. No seizures wereobserved. Of note, although the activity is quite slow ontheleft.It
is not quite as remarkable onthe right.
