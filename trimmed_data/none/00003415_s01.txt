INTRODUCTION: 
Digital video EEG performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one 
channel of EKG. The patient is intubated in a hard collar. 
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: 
The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background is rich in beta but there is an asymmetry between the two 
hemispheres. There is prominent beta in the left frontal region. There is a fair amount of movement and sweat artifact. 
Activity seems to be slower on the right compared to the left. The patient is described as intermittently agitated and when 
he is moving about, there is an increase in theta. As the patient becomes drowsy, the background EEG become slower 
and more feature was on the right in comparison to the left. Right temporal region is slower than other areas. 
Stimulation or arousal from the patient is remarkable for an increase in faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere, 
particularly left temporal region. 
Heart rate 84 BPM. 
IMPRESSION: 
Markedly abnormal EEG due to, 
1. Prominent beta. 
2. Slow background. 
3. Slowing in the right hemisphere, particularly in the temporal region. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG for the patient with bilateral craniotomy and significant contusion and intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the right 
is remarkable for relative preservation of activity on the left. No seizures were noted. The prominent beta activity is more 
commonly seen after the use of a benzodiazepine or barbiturate medication, but none was recorded in the history.
