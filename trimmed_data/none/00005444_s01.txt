DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with 
a small amount of excess theta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record 
producing rhythmic frontally predominant theta. This is followed by drowsiness with an 
Increase in rhythmic slowing and then vertex waves as the patient transitions into stage 
I sleep. Prominent frontal beta is noted in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves are 
somewhat irregular in morphology but not otherwise lateralizing. Photic stimulation is 
performed while the patient is asleep and does not significantly activate the record. 
HR: 60 bpm 
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Mild excess theta. 
2. Very mild background disorganization. 
CLINICAL There were no epileptiform features observed today. 
Previous EEGs are not available at this time.
