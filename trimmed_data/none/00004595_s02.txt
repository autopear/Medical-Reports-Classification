MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Lidocaine, Atomadate, Hydralazine, and many others, 
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.  Topiramate is given.  This section of the record begins at 11:40 and ends at 16:14 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG shows ongoing PLEDS maximum from the frontotemporal regions bilaterally, right greater than left.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency in the background, but doesnâ€™t really change the PLEDS.  There is some variability in terms of the frequency of the PLEDS, and there is also some background theta but no seizures are recorded.  
HR:  120 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal, continuous bedside EEG monitoring due to:
	1.	Ongoing PLEDS in an overall suppressed background. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this poorly responsive patient, this prolonged pattern may be a postictal or late ictal pattern.
