MEDICATIONS:  Dexamethasone, Insulin, Lovenox, Protonix, Metoprolol, Oxycodone, Keppra, Trileptal, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
The patient is somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a severely slow pattern with an intrahemispheric asymmetry, more beta activity on the left and left parietal (P3) sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient produces a brief arousal. This record is slower than the previous study.  In addition, there is a single right parietal sharp wave
	HR:	96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	1.	Generalized background slowing.
	2.	lntrahemispheric asymmetry with breech rhythm on the left.
	3. 	Left parietal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   Compared to the previous study, this EEG is somewhat slower and there is more beta activity compatible with medications.  No seizures were
recorded.
