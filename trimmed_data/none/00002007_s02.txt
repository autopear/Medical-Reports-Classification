MEDICATIONS: Trileptal and Lamictal. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 6.5 to 7 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The overall background is disorganized with excess background theta. There is a breach rhythm on the right with accentuation of beta frequency activity and intermittent attenuation of faster frequency activity.  There are a handful of sharp waves from the right temporal region.  In addition, there is a brief portion of the record with rhythmic slowing from the left.  This is seen in the initial portions of the record and is picked up in the left frontotemporal region, best seen with T1-T2 electrodes and differs from the patient’s eye movement artifact.  
HR:  88 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization. 
Focal features in the region of this patient’s previous craniotomy with a breach rhythm, focal slowing, and occasional interruption of faster frequency activity.
Rare, right anteriotemporal sharp waves. 
An unusual burst of rhythmic left frontal slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background disorganization is similar to previous studies.  The features on the left may be somewhat more prominent in this study and are seen only in one specific section of the record. No seizures were recorded.
