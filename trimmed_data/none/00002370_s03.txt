MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol, Protonix, 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient is lethargic.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in wakefulness/drowsiness includes a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is excess background theta activity and shifting, sharply contoured delta, particularly on the right.   The patient arouses briefly for stimulation and then drifts back to sleep.  There is a suggestion of a breach rhythm, with higher amplitude activity on the right.  
As the patient becomes drowsy in the setting of a breach rhythm, there are occasional sharp waves identified, which can be differentiated from his EKG artifact.  In addition, there is an accentuation of the focal slowing on the right.  There are rare, high amplitude right anterior temporal sharp waves. There are occasional vertex waves and spindles seen in stage II sleep.  
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  
HR:  66 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere maximum in the temporal region.
Occasional right temporal sharp waves.
Intermittent, generalized background slowing. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural abnormality on the right as well as a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The intermittent lethargy with the background slowing may be due to sleep deprivation, medication effect, or postictal state.  No seizures were recorded.
