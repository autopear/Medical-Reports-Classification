REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Atropine, lorazepam, Lovenox, Zoloft, Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of frontocentral beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.  The excessive beta noted during the recording may be seen in relation to medications like benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
