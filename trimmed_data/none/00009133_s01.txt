coded in the field for an unknown amount of time (9:00p.m. on 2/16/09)/ Mild clonus is now 
seen. 
MEDICATIONS: Kayexalate. Dextrose, Insulin, Pantoprazole, heparin, ASA, Aranesp, 
Amlodipine, Metoprolol, Lisinopril. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedtime using standard 10-20 system of 
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: At the start of this epoch, extensive suppression is seen 
throughout the background. Throughout the record there is a theta pattern seen throughout 
both hemispheres. Muscle artifact and difficulty with the electrodes are seen sometimes 
through the record . The technician notes that the-patient is running a fever and is having 
difficulty with the electrode placements at times. Asymmetry is seen with the theta on the right 
hemisphere becoming sharply contoured. specifically in the F4-C4 distributions. There is a 
pseudo-periodicity of the sharply contoured pattern which occurs every 3 seconds in the record. 
As well in the background theta pattern is also seen extensively. 
HR: 126 and irregular. 
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Overall suppression of the background with intermittent beta and theta pattern. 
2. Pseudo-periodic sharply contoured theta in the frontal central regions. 
CORRELATION: The suppression of the background and generalized slowing are 
consistent with anoxic insult. The sharply contoured theta pattern in the right hemisphere cortex. No seizures were recorded.
