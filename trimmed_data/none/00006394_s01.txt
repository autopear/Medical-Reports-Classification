MEDICATIONS: None 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 _Channel EKG, Photic stimulation performed. 
DESCRIPTION THE RECORD: During wakefulness, there is increased muscle 
artifact specifically seen on the right hemisphere. The overall background is slow with a 
posterior dominant rhythm of Hertz, about 30 microvolts. Consistently through the 
record, the patient had continuous left temporal theta activity TIRTA. At times, left 
temporal sharp. waves are also seen. Photic stimulation shows driving. 
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 
1. Slowing of the background
2. Continuous left temporal theta activity (TIRTA). 
3. Occasional left temporal sharp waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The left temporal slowing is consistent with a focal area of 
structural abnormality. The left temporal sharp waves are consistent with an area of 
irritability and possible focus tor seizure activity. There are no seizures seen 
on this record.
