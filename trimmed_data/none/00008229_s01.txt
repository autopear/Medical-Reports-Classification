REASON FOR STUDY: 
Change in mental status. 
INTRODUCTION: 
An EEG was performed using the 10/20 electrode placement system with EKG electrodes and anterior temporal lobe electrode. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. No activation procedures were performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
CellCept, Vancomycin, Zosyn, ursodiol, and Diflucan. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
None. 
DESCRIPTION ON RECORD: 
The record opens to diffusely slow background in the delta and theta frequencies with about frequencies at 5Hz. There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and an absent frontal central beta rhythm. Sleep is characterized by some vertex complexes, but no typical architecture is seen. Hyperventilation or photic stimulation are not performed. When stimulated the patient, EEG does appear to improving frequency to a faster frequency, but quickly returns to the slow background and now reaches the normal background. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Generalized slow waves of 2 to 4 Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude. 
SEIZURES: 
None. 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG due to generalized slow waves. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology in this patient. (______) in part due to metabolic encephalopathy. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
