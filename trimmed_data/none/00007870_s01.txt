MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and insulin. 
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient does not speak English and is drowsy throughout the record.  In addition, there are difficulties obtaining the proper impedances at the bedside.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are brief portions of the record where the background includes a low voltage, 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  During much of the record, the patient is drowsy and in this state, there is an increase in background theta.  She drifts in and out of stage I and II sleep with high amplitude vertex waves.  There are a handful of discharges which occur in the transition to sleep with bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude 3.5 Hz activity, which looks like vertex activity, which are maximum in the left hemisphere at C3/CZ.  These are relatively high amplitude for this individual.  Snore artifact is seen as are multiple arousals from sleep.  On one occasion, there is also a burst of sharply contoured 3.5 Hz activity in the left centrotemporal region.  
HR:  104 BPM.
	IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic, high amplitude, sharply contoured 3.5 Hz activity seen in the left central and centrotemporal regions in drowsiness.
	2.	Hypersomnolence.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial or localization-related mechanism for this patient’s epilepsy. The activity in the left centrotemporal region is very isolated in the EEG and on rare occasions, there is almost an underlying discrete sharp wave at T3, but it has consistent localization.  No seizures were recorded. Given her snoring, evaluation for this patient’s hypersomnolence is recommended.
